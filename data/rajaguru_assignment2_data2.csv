Sector,Industry,Topic,Definition
Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Product Safety,"Information on product safety and side effects can surface after controlled clinical trials and approval. Subsequently, entities are exposed to the financial implications of recalls and other adverse events. Issues related to product safety, such as equipment failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks, can lead to significant product liability claims. Firms that limit the incidence of recalls, safety concerns, and enforcement actions for manufacturing concerns may be better positioned to protect shareholder value."
Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Supply Chain Management,"Supply chain quality is essential to protecting consumer health and corporate value. Medical equipment and supplies firmsthat fail to ensure quality and traceability throughout their supply chains are susceptible to fines, lost revenue, and reputational damage. In addition, entities may need to manage the use of material inputs that are considered scarce. Disclosure of supply chain audit programs, strategies to ensure traceability, and the management of critical materials may provide shareholders with an understanding of how entities in this industry are protecting shareholder value."
Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Ethical Marketing,"Medical equipment and supplies entities face challenges associated with marketing of specific products. Direct-to-consumer advertisements for medical devices and outreach to physicians provide opportunities for increasing market share. However, challenges arise from the potential for marketing off-label uses, which can result in significant fines and settlements. Corporate disclosure of legal and regulatory fines and the codes of ethics that govern marketing activities will allow shareholders to better understand performance in this area. "
Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Business Ethics,"Medical equipment and supplies entities are subject to various international, national, and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. For example, in the U.S., anti-kickback laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act generally prohibit entities from making payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The ability of entities to ensurecompliance throughout their global and domestic operational footprint may have material implications. Corporate disclosure of legal and regulatory fines and the codes of ethics that govern interactions with health professionals may allow shareholders to monitor performance in this area."
Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Product Design & Lifecycle Management,"Medical equipment and supplies entities face increasing challenges associated with the human and environmental impact of the industry’s products. Entities may face consumer and regulatory pressure to limit the use of material inputs associated with health concerns, while also addressing issues such as the energy efficiency and end-of-life disposal of specific products. Entities that address these concerns while engaging in efforts to enhance product take-back may satisfyconsumer demand and reduce future liabilities better."
Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Affordability & Pricing,"Legislative emphasis on health care cost containment and increased access is likely to continue to place downward pricingpressures on the Medical Equipment & Supplies industry. This pressure may be further articulated by consolidation among health care providers and the role of government-sponsored insurance programs. In the U.S., for example, entities that have relied on contractual advantages to protect profits may be challenged to enhance value as the government seeks to reduce its Medicare and Medicaid spending. Firms that are able to ensure fair pricing are likely to limit the negative impact of cost containment while recognising the potential revenue opportunities associated with expanded access."
Transportation,Airlines,Competitive Behaviour,"The Airlines industry is characterised by competitive margins due to high fixed capital and labour costs and competition with government-subsidised carriers in some markets. This pushes airlines to find economies of scale through alliances or consolidation, leading to concentration of the market. The industry is also characterised by high barriers to entry due to limited landing rights and increasing airport congestion. Together, these characteristics may lead entities to engage in anti-competitive practices that increase prices for consumers. As a result, antitrust authorities have scrutinised certain airline industry practices such as airport slot management, predatory pricing, and alliances and mergers. This creates a material risk to investors stemming from legal fees, reputational risk, costs associated with a delayed merger or acquisition transaction, and limits on growth by acquisition or merger."
Transportation,Airlines,Labour Practices,"Many workers in the Airlines industry are covered under collective bargaining agreements that cover fair wages, safe working conditions, and freedom of association, which are among basic worker rights. Unionisation of key personnel mayresult in higher labour costs via wage or benefits increase. At the same time, labour practices can impact the long-term profitability of the business. Effective management of, and communication around, issues such as worker pay and working conditions can prevent conflicts with workers that could lead to extended periods of strikes, which can slow or shut down operations and damage an entity’s reputation, potentially reducing revenue and market share."
Transportation,Airlines,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"As a result of a heavy reliance on hydrocarbon fuels, the Airlines industry generates significant emissions, more than 99% of which are in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, the industry is subject to compliance costs and risks associated with climate change mitigation policies. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for airlines entities are aircraft fuel use and emissions, ground equipment and facility electricity. Aircraft fuel consumption is the largest contributor to total emissions from the industry, and fuel management is a critical part of reducing emissions. Management of fuel-related environmental impacts includes increasing fuel efficiency through fleet upgrades, retrofits, and flight speed and route design optimisation, as well as using alternative and sustainable fuels. These initiatives require capital expenditures, but in the long term, they may reduce fuel costs and decrease exposure to GHG emissions programmes and regulatory risk."
Transportation,Airlines,Accident & Safety Management,"Given the nature of air travel in which accidents can result in significant consequences, passenger safety is paramount in the Airlines industry. Although air travel is one of the safest modes of transport, airlines are held to very high safety standards and consumers expect accident-free operations. Furthermore, as products transported by air tend to be high-value or perishable goods, delivering them safely and in a timely manner is a priority for any carrier. Airline accidents may result in significant environmental and social externalities and require entities to pay for remediation and compensation ofvictims. Safety incidents or violations of safety regulations can have a chronic impact on an entity’s reputation, increasing its risk profile and cost of capital, and lead to lower demand from passengers as well as cargo shippers, hurting revenues. Larger accidents, even if they occur rarely, can lead to significant and long-term impacts on reputation and revenue growth. Providing adequate safety training and ensuring the health and well-being of crew members is critical to ensuringsafety. Equally important is timely and adequate maintenance of aircraft, which can help entities minimise the chances of technical failure and avoid severe regulatory penalties for non-compliance."
Consumer Goods,Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors,Workforce Diversity & Inclusion,"The Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors industry is consumer-facing and relies on the ability to communicate effectively with customers during the sales process and adapt to changing consumer demands for products. As the populations of many developed markets undergo a massive demographic shift, including increases in minority populations, entities in this industry can benefit from ensuring that their entity culture and hiring and promotion practicesembrace the building of a diverse workforce at management- and junior-level positions. Retailers that respond to this demographic shift and employ staff who will be able to recognise the needs of diverse populations may be better able to capture demand from segments that have traditionally been overlooked, which can provide entities a competitive advantage. Furthermore, such entities may benefit from decreased legal and regulatory risks, as well as improved reputational value."
Consumer Goods,Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors,"Product Sourcing, Packaging & Marketing","Entities in the Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors industry sell a wide array of products including electronics, clothing, furnishings, and cosmetics, which all have varying environmental and social impacts throughout their lifecycles. The size and subsequent buying power of many entities in this industry allow them to work with their suppliers to source products and packaging with lower lifecycle environmental and social impacts. Entities that perform well in this regard may benefit from increased customer demand and improved margins. Taking a proactive approach to engaging suppliers, using certification standards, and reducing the environmental impacts of packaging are strategies commonly employed byentities in the industry."
Consumer Goods,Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors,Energy Management in Retail & Distribution,"Entities in this industry require significant amounts of energy for retail facilities and warehouses. An increasing number of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations and incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy may result in price increases for conventional electricity sources while making alternative sources more cost-competitive. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change andpollution. Energy sourcing decisions can create trade-offs related to energy supply costs and operational reliability. Overall energy efficiency and access to alternative energy sources are becoming increasingly important for entities to manage. Efficiency in this area can have financial implications through direct cost savings, which are particularly beneficial in this low-margin industry."
Consumer Goods,Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors,Labour Practices,"Retail’s significance to the U.S. economy as a major employer means that it is also often at the centre of public labour-practice discussions. This can have serious reputational implications for entities in the industry whose performance on labour relations is poor. The low-average wages in the industry, which help entities maintain low prices on products, may increase these labour-related risks. Since customers regularly interact directly with employees, entities can face a decrease in market share and revenue from negative consumer sentiment due to public disagreement between entities and their workers. Entities can enhance labour productivity and employee engagement by taking a long-term approach to managing workers in areas such as compensation and workers’ rights. In addition to mitigating risks, improvements in labour productivity can help strengthen an entity’s reputation and reduce its cost of capital."
Consumer Goods,Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors,Data Security,"Consumers trust retail entities with their financial and personal data every time they make a noncash transaction. Credit cards and debit cards have steadily eclipsed cash and cheques as consumers’ preferred payment methods. In these noncash transactions, retailers build up a relationship of trust with consumers, assuring them of the safety of their personal information. Data breaches can occur both through breaches of the physical payment technology, called point-of-sales breaches, as well as through cyber attacks. As consumers become more educated about the threats of cybercrime, particularly in the wake of continued high-profile attacks, having a reputation as a secure entity is increasinglyimportant to maintain or gain market share. Retailers that prevent major data breaches can also avoid harming brand value and reduce liabilities."
Technology & Communications,Hardware,Supply Chain Management,"Entities in the Hardware industry commonly have relatively narrow profit margins and remain competitive by relying on complex, global supply chains, and outsourced production to electronics manufacturing services (EMS) entities. Because entities in the industry typically contract with suppliers in countries with the lowest direct costs, the industry’s products areoften manufactured in countries that have limited regulations or enforcement protecting workers. Entities in the industry have limited direct control over social and environmental standards in production, making improving performance on the issue difficult to manage. This dynamic can heighten an entity’s exposure to reputational risks and impacts on short- and long-term costs and sales. Such effects can arise from increasing regulation and its enforcement in response to high-profile safety or labour incidents, or through a shift in demand away from entities associated with such incidents. Entities that actively manage the impacts generated by the supply chain through the use of standards, monitoring, and engagement with suppliers may be better positioned to protect shareholder value over the long term."
Technology & Communications,Hardware,Employee Diversity & Inclusion,"Despite efforts by the industry to improve workforce diversity and inclusion, hardware entity workforces are characterised by relatively low representation from women and minority groups. Greater workforce diversity is important for innovation as it helps entities understand the needs of a diverse and global customer base, which results in the ability to design desirable products and communicate with customers effectively. Entities that are unable to attract and retain diverse talent may risk losing market share to competitors that successfully employ a staff capable of recognising the needs of diverse populations and capturing demand from segments that have traditionally been overlooked. Furthermore, entities seen as being more representative of their diverse, global customer base are likely to see increased brand loyalty which can also be a source of competitive advantage. Entities that are successful in recruiting and retaining a diverse and inclusive workforce can also avoid high rates of turnover, resulting in cost savings."
Technology & Communications,Hardware,Product Security,"The hardware products and related software offered by entities in the Hardware industry can have vulnerabilities that expose consumers to data security threats. Therefore, hardware manufacturers play an important role in ensuring security of user data. Such vulnerabilities may occur at any stage of a product lifecycle, including product design, the manufacturing supply chain, product distribution, and the product’s use-phase. Entities in the industry that are unable to establish a robust approach to identifying vulnerabilities may risk exposing consumer data to security threats and potentially eroding the trust of their customer base. The increasing prevalence of cybersecurity threats creates both risks and opportunities for the Hardware industry, as effective product security can be a source of competitive advantage, thus helping entities to increase their sales and expand market share. Additionally, concerns about data security and related government actions can also serve as revenue-generating opportunities for this industry through opportunities for federal contracts and the provision of security products."
Technology & Communications,Hardware,Materials Sourcing,"Entities in the Hardware industry rely on numerous critical materials as key inputs for finished products. Many of these inputs have few or no available substitutes and are often sourced from deposits concentrated in only a few countries, many of which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Other sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry’s supply chain operations are also increasingly shaping the industry’s ability to source materials. Additionally, increased competition for these materials due to growing global demand from other sectors can result in price increases and supply risks. The ability of entities to manage potential material shortages, supply disruptions, price volatility, and reputational risks is made more difficult by the fact that they commonly source materials from supply chains that often lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue can lead to an inability to access necessary materials, reduced margins, constrained revenue growth, and/or higher costs or capital. "
Technology & Communications,Hardware,Product Lifecycle Management,"Entities in the Hardware industry face increasing challenges associated with environmental and social externalities attributed to product manufacturing, transport, use and disposal. Rapid obsolescence of hardware products may worsen these externalities. Entities are designing more products with the entire lifecycle in mind. Specific considerations include energy efficiency of products, hazardous material inputs, and designing for and facilitating safe end-of-life disposal and recycling. Entities that prioritise designing and manufacturing products with improved environmental and social impacts may avoid costs associated with externalities, and they may be more likely to grow consumer demand and market share, while eliminating potentially harmful materials. Furthermore, entities that minimise environmental and social externalities of products may be less exposed to increasing regulation and costs, such as those related to extended producer responsibility."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,"Employee Recruitment, Development & Retention","Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals entities face intense competition for employees. The industry relies on highly skilled employees to develop new products, conduct clinical trials, manage government regulations, and commercialise new products. Firms that are able to attract and retain employees in light of a constrained talent pool may be better positionedto protect and enhance shareholder value."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Supply Chain Management,"For the Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals industry, supply chain quality is essential to protecting consumer health and corporate value. Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals firms that fail to ensure quality throughout their supply chains are susceptible to lost revenue, supply disruptions, and reputational damage. Disclosure of supply chain audit programs may provide shareholders with an understanding of how entities in this industry are protecting shareholder value."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Ethical Marketing,"Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals entities face challenges associated with the marketing of specific products. Direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription drugs provide opportunities for increasing market share. However, challenges arise from the potential for marketing off-label uses, which can result in significant fines and settlements. Corporate disclosure of legal and regulatory fines and the codes of ethics that govern marketing activities will allow shareholders to better understand performance in this area."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Drug Safety,"Information on product safety can surface after controlled clinical trials and regulatory approval. Subsequently, entities areexposed to the financial implications of recalls and other adverse events. Product safety concerns, manufacturing defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks can lead to significant product liability claims. Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals firms that limit the incidence of recalls, safety concerns, and enforcement actions for manufacturing concerns may be better positioned to protect shareholder value. In addition, concern over the abuse or resale of certain medications has led to mandated take-back programs. Firms that are able to successfully engage in these programs may limit future liabilities."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Access to Medicines,"Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals entities play an important role in providing access to the industry’s products around the world. Firms can develop pricing frameworks that account for differing levels of economic development and health care needs across various countries. Further, the industry can target priority diseases in developing countries. Strategic approaches related to access to medicines can yield opportunities for growth, innovation, and unique partnerships, whichmay enhance shareholder value."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Business Ethics,"Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals firms are subject to various international, national, and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. For example, in the U.S., anti-kickback laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act generally prohibit entities from making payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The ability of entities to ensurecompliance throughout their global and domestic operational footprint may have material implications. Corporate disclosure of legal and regulatory fines and the codes of ethics that govern interactions with health professionals may allow shareholders to monitor performance in this area."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Safety of Clinical Trial Participants,Clinical trials are an essential component of the approval process for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. The safety of clinical trial participants is a critical component of an entity’s ability to successfully bring a product to market. Oversight of these trials is an important factor in the industry due to the number of clinical trials conducted by third party contract research organisations as well as those conducted in emerging markets. Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals entities that effectively manage clinical trials may be positioned to enhance shareholder value through the revenue associated with new products.
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Counterfeit Drugs,"The World Health Organization estimates that counterfeit drugs represent more than 10 percent of the pharmaceutical supply chain in low and middle-income countries. The issue of fake or substandard medication also presents a significant risk in developed economies. Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals entities may face added costs as numerous governments and agencies have implemented drug supply chain regulations in an effort to prevent counterfeit, substandard, or mislabeled drugs from entering the pharmaceutical distribution system. Entities that fail to manage this issue effectively may face material risks associated with the potential loss of public confidence and reduced revenue."
Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,Affordability & Pricing,"Stakeholder emphasis on health care cost containment and increased access will likely continue to place downward pricing pressures on the Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals industry. As a result, entities that have relied on raising drug prices, contractual advantages, and reverse payments to protect profits may be challenged to enhance value by efforts to reduce costs. Firms that prevent stakeholder scrutiny of pricing practices may limit their exposure to issues such as regulatory action, or adverse reputational impacts."
Health Care,Health Care Distributors,Product Safety,"Health care distributors play an integral role in the delivery of health care products to consumers. The industry therefore has a shared responsibility with manufacturers to ensure product safety and address concerns related to toxicity. Further, health care distributors face additional risks related to controlled substances and the potential for mislabeled products. Entities that limit the incidences of safety or other product concerns may be better positioned to protect shareholder value."
Health Care,Health Care Distributors,Fleet Fuel Management,"The distribution of health care products and supplies requires significant transportation networks. Concern over climate change and dwindling natural resources may affect fuel pricing, and it may expose health care distributors to cost fluctuations. Entities that improve transportation efficiencies may be better positioned to create value over the long-term."
Health Care,Health Care Distributors,Business Ethics,"Health care distributors are subject to various state, national, and international laws. In the U.S., such laws include the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Entities that are able to ensure compliance with relevant regulations may avoid litigation, which can result in costly fines or settlements."
Health Care,Health Care Distributors,Product Lifecycle Management,Health care distributors have a responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of the products that they distribute. Specific opportunities to address these impacts exist in product packaging and take-back programs. Entities that are able to address these concerns may be better positioned to meet customer demand and reduce associated costs.
Health Care,Health Care Distributors,Counterfeit Drugs,The World Health Organization estimates that counterfeit drugs represent more than 10 percent of the pharmaceutical supply chain in low and middle-income countries. The issue of counterfeit or substandard medication also presents a significant risk in developed economies. Health care distributors may face added costs as governments and national regulatory agencies seek to implement drug supply chain regulations in an effort to prevent counterfeit or mislabeled drugs from entering the pharmaceutical distribution system.
Financials,Insurance,Financed Emissions,"Entities participating in insurance activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissions associatedwith those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher emissions might be more susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change which in turn can impact the prospects of a financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations orother policies; credit risk might also arise through related technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financingfossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in insurance activities are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This measurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how it might need to adapt its financial activities over time."
Financials,Insurance,Policies Designed to Incentivise Responsible Behaviour,"Advances in technology and the development of new policy products have allowed insurance entities to limit claim payments while encouraging responsible behaviour. The industry is subsequently in a unique position to generate positive social and environmental externalities. Insurance entities can incentivise healthy lifestyles and safe behaviour as well as develop sustainability-related projects and technologies, such as those focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency and carbon capture. As the renewable energy industry continues to grow, insurance entities may seek related growth opportunities by underwriting insurance in this area. Additionally, policy clauses may encourage customers to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to mitigate overall underwriting portfolio risk, which may reduce insurance pay-outs over the long term. Therefore, disclosure on products related to energy efficiency and low carbon technology, as well as discussion of how entities incentivise health, safety or environmentally responsible actions or behaviours, may assist investors in assessing how insurance entities incentivise responsible behaviour."
Financials,Insurance,Systemic Risk Management,"Insurance entities have the potential to pose, amplify, or transmit a threat to the financial system. The size, interconnectedness, and complexity of insurance entities are factors that highlight exposure to systemic risk for entities in the industry. Insurance entities that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities have been identified by regulators as being more vulnerable to financial market developments and subsequently more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, insurance entities face the potential of being designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions. Such firms are subject to stricter prudential regulatory standards and oversight by the central banking systems in various jurisdictions. Specifically, these insurance entities will likely face limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, and credit exposure. In addition, insurance entities will be required to maintain a plan forrapid and orderly dissolution in the event of financial distress. Regulatory compliance can be very costly, while the failure to meet qualitative and quantitative regulatory performance thresholds could lead to substantial penalties. To demonstrate how these risks are being managed, insurance entities should enhance their disclosures of key aspects of systemic risk management and their ability to meet stricter regulatory requirements."
Financials,Insurance,Transparent Information & Fair Advice for Customers,"Insurance products play an important societal role in alleviating the impact of unexpected economic shocks, allowing policyholders to minimise the financial impact of events such as illnesses, accidents, and deaths. However, the risks of unclear insurance policies, ambiguous product terms, and potentially misleading sales tactics can erode brand reputation, lead to legal disputes, and reduce the number of services and products offered. This may be especially true if regulators deem certain policies overly complex and unsuitable for customers. Moreover, insurance entities compete on the basis of financial strength, price, brand reputation, services offered, and customer relationships. Customer dissatisfaction may reduce insurance usage, potentially leading to extremely negative financial outcomes for individuals and families, such as personal bankruptcies. As financial regulators continue to emphasise consumer protection and accountability, entities thatmaintain transparent policy terms and direct customers toward the products best suited to them will be better positioned to maintain their brand reputation, avoid regulatory scrutiny, and protect shareholder value. Failure to inform customers about products in a clear and transparent manner may result in higher number of complaints filed against entities, customer churn, and in some instances, regulatory fines and settlements."
Financials,Insurance,Physical Risk Exposure,"Catastrophic losses associated with extreme weather events will continue to have a material, adverse effect on the Insurance industry. The extent of this effect may evolve as climate change increases the frequency and severity of both modelled and non-modelled natural catastrophes, including hurricanes, floods and droughts. Failure to appropriately understand environmental risks, and price them into the underwritten insurance products, may result in higher-than-expected claims on policies. Therefore, insurance entities that incorporate climate change considerations into their underwriting process for individual contracts, and well as the management of entity-level risks and capital adequacy, may be better positioned to create value over the long-term. Enhanced disclosure of an entity’s approach to incorporating these factors, in addition to quantitative data such as the probable maximum loss and total losses attributable to insurance pay-outs, may provide investors with the information necessary to assess current and future performance on this issue."
Financials,Insurance,Factors in Investment Management,"Insurance entities must invest capital to preserve accumulated premium revenues equivalent to expected policy claim pay-outs and maintain long-term asset-liability parity. Because environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors increasinglyhave a material impact on the performance of corporations and other assets, insurance entities increasingly must incorporate these factors into their investment management. Failure to address these issues may diminish risk-adjusted portfolio returns and limit an entity’s ability to issue claim payments. Entities, therefore, should enhance disclosure on how they incorporate ESG factors, including climate change and natural resource constraints, into the investment of policy premiums and how they affect the portfolio risk."
Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,"Recruiting & Managing a Global, Diverse & Skilled Workforce","Employees are key contributors to value creation in the Software & IT Services industry. While the number of job openingsin the industry continues to grow, entities commonly find it difficult to recruit qualified employees to fill these positions. The shortage in technically skilled domestic employees has created intense competition to acquire highly skilled employees, contributing to high employee turnover rates. To respond to talent shortages, entities often hire foreign nationals and offshore operations, creating employee management and sustainability challenges and related business risks. Some entities contribute to relevant education and training programs to expand the availability of domestic, skilled employees. Entities offer significant monetary and non-monetary benefits to improve employee engagement and therefore retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve employee engagement and work-life balance may influence therecruitment and retention of a diverse workforce. The industry is characterised by relatively low representation from women and minority groups; efforts to recruit from and develop diverse talent pools can serve to address the talent shortage and generally improve the value of entity offerings. Greater workforce diversity is important for innovation and helps entities understand the needs of their diverse and global customer base."
Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,Data Privacy & Freedom of Expression,"As software and IT services entities increasingly deliver products and services over the Internet and through mobile devices, they must carefully manage two separate and often conflicting priorities. On the one hand, entities use customer data to innovate and provide customers with new products and services and to generate revenues. On the other hand, there are privacy concerns associated with entities having access to a wide range of customer data, such as personal, demographic, content, and behavioural data. This dynamic is leading to increased regulatory scrutiny in many countries around the world. The delivery of cloud-based software and IT services also raises concerns about potential access to user data by governments that may use it to limit the freedoms of citizens. Effective management in this area is important to reduce regulatory and reputational risks that can lead to decreased revenues, lower market share, and regulatory actions involving potential fines and other legal costs."
Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,Intellectual Property Protection & Competitive Behaviour,"Entities in the Software & IT Services industry spend a significant proportion of their revenues on IP protection, including acquiring patents and copyrights. While IP protection is inherent to the business model of some entities in the industry and is an important driver of innovation, entities’ IP practices can sometimes be a contentious societal issue. Entities couldsometimes acquire patents and other IP protection to restrict competition and access to benefits from innovation, particularly if they are dominant market players. Due to the complexity of software, its abstract nature, and increasing IP rights protection related to software, entities in the industry must navigate overlapping patent claims to be able to operate. As a result, entities in the industry may find themselves constantly in litigation or subject to regulatory scrutiny either due to allegations of patent violations if they engage in unethical business practices, or are perceived as doing so, or because they are suing others for IP infringement. Adverse legal or regulatory rulings related to antitrust and IP can expose entities in the industry to costly and lengthy litigations and potential monetary losses as a result. Such rulings may also affect an entity’s market share and pricing power if its patents or dominant position in key markets are legally challenged, with potentially significant impacts on revenue. Therefore, entities that can balance the protection of their IP and its use to spur innovation while ensuring their IP management and other business practices do not unfairly restrict competition, have the potential to lower regulatory scrutiny and legal actions while protecting their market value."
Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure,"With the growth of cloud-based service offerings, entities in this industry own, operate or rent increasingly more data centres and other hardware. Thus, managing the energy and water use associated with IT hardware infrastructure is relevant to value creation. Data centres must be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material effect on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Entities face a trade-off between energy and water consumption because of data centre cooling needs. Cooling data centres with water instead of chillers improves energy efficiency, but this method may create dependence on significant local water resources. Data centre specification decisions are important for managing costs, obtaining a reliable supply of energy and water, and reducing reputational risks, particularly with the increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and the opportunities arising from energy efficiency and renewable energy innovations."
Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions,"With trends towards increased cloud computing and Software as a Service (SaaS), software and IT service providers must ensure they have robust infrastructure and policies in place to minimise disruptions to their services. Disruptions such as programming errors or server downtime may generate systemic risks, because computing and data storage functions move from individual entity servers in various industries to data centres of cloud-computing service providers. The risks areincreased particularly if the affected customers are in sensitive sectors, such as financial institutions or utilities, which are considered critical national infrastructure. Entities’ investments in improving the reliability and quality of their IT infrastructure and services may attract and retain customers, thereby creating revenue and opportunities in new markets."
Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,Data Security,"Software & IT services entities are targets of growing data security threats from cyber attacks and social engineering, which puts their own data and their customers’ data at risk. Inadequate prevention, detection, and remediation of data security threats can influence customer acquisition and retention and result in decreased market share and lower demand for the entity’s products. In addition to reputational damage and customer turnover, data breaches can also result in increased expenses, commonly associated with remediation efforts such as identity protection offerings and employee training on data protection. Meanwhile, new and emerging data security standards and regulations are likely to affect theoperating expenses of entities through increased costs of compliance. Additionally, entities in this industry are well-positioned to uncover revenue opportunities by providing secure software and services to meet the demand for ensuring data is kept secure. "
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Recruiting & Managing a Global & Skilled Workforce,"Employees are key contributors to value creation in the Semiconductors industry. Entities face competition and challenges in recruiting qualified employees, including electrical engineers, research scientists, and process engineers, and compensation for such employees is a significant cost component for the industry. To respond to domestic talent shortages, semiconductors entities are increasingly recruiting foreign nationals, even as they offshore operations, resultingin associated human capital management challenges. Hiring foreign nationals to compensate for shortages in local talent can create risks related to perceived social implications in the host and home countries of workers. Semiconductors entities can improve their competitive positioning by establishing education, training, and recruitment policies that develop and leverage the talents of skilled, global employees to meet their human capital needs. Such initiatives can help drive innovation and improve worker productivity, thereby improving access to new markets and possible new sources of revenue, while also creating a more engaged workforce that is less likely to experience high rates of turnover."
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Water Management,"Water is critical to the semiconductor production process, which requires significant volumes of ‘ultra-pure’ water for cleaning purposes, to avoid trace molecules from affecting product quality. As manufacturing becomes more complex, entities in the industry are discovering the importance of reducing ultra-pure water use. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the world, because of increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanisation, and reduced supplies because of climate change. Furthermore, water pollution in developing countries makes available water supplies unusable or expensive to treat. Without careful planning, water scarcity may result in higher supply costs, social tensions with local communities and governments, or loss of water access in water-scarce regions, thereby presenting a critical risk to production. Semiconductor entities that increase water use efficiency during manufacturing may maintain a lower risk profile and face reduced regulatory risks as local, regional and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation."
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Entities in the Semiconductors industry generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly those from perfluorinated compounds, from semiconductor manufacturing operations. GHG emissions may create regulatory compliance costs and operating risks for semiconductors entities, although resulting financial effects may vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. Entities that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative chemicals or manufacturing process advances may benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk."
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Energy Management in Manufacturing,"Energy is a critical input for manufacturing semiconductor devices. The price of conventional grid electricity and volatility of fossil fuel prices may increase because of evolving climate change regulations and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other factors, while alternative energy sources become more cost-competitive. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as alternative energy use, may create trade-offs related to the energy supply’scost and reliability for operations. As industry innovation adds complexity to manufacturing processes, new technologies to manufacture semiconductors may consume more energy unless entities invest in the energy efficiency of their operations. The way an entity manages energy efficiency, reliance on different types of energy, the associated sustainability risks, and alternative energy source access may affect financial performance."
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Materials Sourcing,"Entities in the Semiconductors industry rely on numerous critical materials as key inputs for finished products. Many of these inputs have few or no available substitutes and are often sourced from deposits concentrated in few countries, many of which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Other sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry’s supply chain operates are also increasingly shaping the industry’s ability to source materials. Additionally, increased competition for these materials due to growing global demand from other sectors can result in price increases and supply risks. The ability of entities to manage potential materials shortages, supply disruptions, price volatility, and reputational risks is made more difficult by the fact that they commonly source materials from supply chains that often lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue can lead to an inability to access necessary materials, reduced margins, constrained revenue growth, and/or higher costs or capital. "
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Intellectual Property Protection & Competitive Behaviour,"While intellectual property (IP) protection is inherent to the business model of entities in the Semiconductors industry, entities’ IP practices can be a contentious societal issue. IP protection, on the one hand, is an important driver of innovation; on the other hand, some entities may also acquire and enforce patents and other IP protection in efforts to restrict competition, particularly if they are dominant market players. Industry standard-setting can involve complex negotiations over patent rights and licensing terms, and entities are using cross-licenses and patent pools to address difficulties around patent thickets. However, such industry cooperation can also raise antitrust concerns, for example, withprovisions in portfolio cross-licenses that could enable price fixing. Adverse legal or regulatory rulings related to antitrust and IP can expose software and IT services entities to costly and lengthy litigations and potential monetary losses as a result. Such rulings may also affect an entity’s market share and pricing power if its patents or dominant position in key markets are legally challenged, with significant impact on revenue. Therefore, entities that can balance the protection of their IP and its use to spur innovation with ensuring their IP management and other business practices do not unfairly restrict competition, have the potential to lower regulatory scrutiny and legal actions while protecting their market value."
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Product Lifecycle Management,"As an increasing number of devices become connected to each other and to the internet, semiconductor entities face greater demand for products that increase computing power and decrease energy costs. Semiconductor machinery and device manufacturers may reduce the environmental and human health impacts of their products by increasing the energy-efficiency of equipment and chips and reducing the use of harmful materials in products. As consumer demand grows for energy-efficient devices that increase battery life, reduce heat output and decrease energy consumption, semiconductor manufacturers that satisfy these may gain a competitive advantage, driving revenue and market share growth. Entities also may benefit from reducing the use of toxic materials from chips destined for consumer devices, which has implications for the end-of-life management of electronic waste, an issue of growing legislative importance in many countries."
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Employee Health & Safety,"The long-term impact on worker health from chemical usage in semiconductor manufacturing is a major area of concern for the industry. Workers in fabrication facilities, particularly maintenance workers, are at risk of exposure to chemicals known to be hazardous to human health. Violations of health and safety standards can result in monetary penalties and additional costs of corrective actions, with an impact on net profits and contingent liabilities. Furthermore, such violations can also lead to non-monetary penalties and reputational impacts which can decrease revenues, as well as market share. Effective management of health and safety issues include implementing effective engineering controls, introducing less hazardous chemicals where possible or using smaller amounts, and seeking chemicals presenting the fewest risks to the workforce. In addition to protecting brand value, entities taking these measures can also protect themselves from adverse legal outcomes related to both regulated and unregulated hazardous substances. "
Technology & Communications,Semiconductors,Waste Management,"Semiconductor manufacturing requires hazardous materials, many of which are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations, and generates harmful waste, which may be released into the environment in the form of water and air emissions, and solid waste. The handling and disposal of hazardous wastes produced during manufacturing can lead to increased operating costs, capital expenditures, and in some instances, regulatory costs. Entities that are able to reducewaste produced during manufacturing and ensure that it is reused, recycled, or disposed of appropriately, will maintain a lower risk profile and face lower regulatory risks as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation and waste management."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Entities in the Agricultural Products industry generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from processing and transporting goods via land and sea freight operations. Emissions regulations may increase the cost of capital, operationalcosts and affect the operational efficiency of entities without strategies to manage GHG emissions. Employing innovative technologies that use alternative fuels and energy inputs—including biomass waste generated from internal processes—and improving fuel efficiency are ways entities can limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, supply disruptions, future regulatory costs and other potential consequences of GHG emissions."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Water Management,"The Agricultural Products industry relies on water for processing activities, and entities in the industry also typically generate wastewater or effluent. The availability of water, because of physical availability or regulatory access, directly impacts the industry’s ability to operate processing facilities efficiently. Entities in the industry increasingly are exposed to water-related risks and regulations, which may increase capital expenditure costs, operating costs, remediation costs or potential fines. Entities can manage water-related risks and opportunities and mitigate long-term costs through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and work with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent. A separate supply chain-oriented topic, Ingredient Sourcing, addresses the risks related to crop production driven by water availability and access."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Food Safety,"Agricultural products are either sold directly to consumers in raw form or are further processed before reaching consumers. Maintaining product quality and safety is critical, as contamination by pathogens, chemicals, or spoilage presents serious human and animal health risks. Contamination may result from poor farming, transport, storage, or handling practices. Food quality and safety issues can lead to consumer-driven demand changes and regulatory action. Product recalls can harm brand reputation, reduce revenues, and lead to costly fines. Obtaining food safety certifications or ensuring suppliers meet food safety guidelines may help entities in the industry safeguard against product safety risks and communicate the quality of their products to buyers."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,GMO Management,"Agricultural products developed using genetically modified organism (GMO) technology have gained increasing consumerinterest. While GMO technology has, in many cases, enabled improvements in crop yield through development of disease or drought resistant traits in plants, there is increasing consumer concern on the perceived health, environmental, and/or social impacts related to the cultivation and consumption of GMOs. Certain countries and geographic regions have also enacted regulations that ban the usage or cultivation of GMOs. Food and beverage entities along the food supply chain, including entities in this industry, are seeking effective means to assess GMO-related risks and opportunities, and communicate with consumers on the topic. Agricultural products entities that are able to meet changing consumer trendsand regulatory changes through their product mix or effective communications may reduce potential reputational risks and revenue loss as well as capture new market share opportunities. "
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Energy Management,"Processing and milling agricultural products require substantial energy input. While some agricultural products entities generate energy on-site through the direct combustion of fossil fuels or biomass, most energy is procured from the electrical grid. Energy consumption contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Energy management affects current and future costs of operation. Climate regulation and other sustainability factors could resultin higher or more volatile electricity and fuel prices, increasing operating costs for agricultural products entities. Therefore,energy efficiency gained through process improvements can lower operating costs. The trade-off between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity as well as the use of alternative energy can play important roles in influencing both the long-term cost and reliability of an entity’s energy supply and the extent of regulatory impact from direct versus indirect emissions."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Workforce Health & Safety,"Industrial processes used in the Agricultural Products industry present significant occupational hazards. Employees are engaged in many labour-intensive activities. Common hazards include falls, transportation accidents, equipment-related accidents, and heat-related illness or injury, among others. Violations of health and safety standards could result in monetary penalties and costs for corrective actions. High injury rates, particularly fatality rates, may indicate a weak governance structure and a weak workplace safety culture, as well as lead to significant reputational harm. Strong performance on managing workforce health and safety can help build brand image while promoting worker morale, which may lead to increased productivity, reduced worker turnover, and enhanced community relations."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Ingredient Sourcing,"Agricultural products entities source a wide variety of commodities and ingredients from farmers or intermediary distributors. The industry’s ability to reliably source ingredients at desired price points fluctuates with crop yield, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management and other resource scarcity considerations. Entities that source more productive and less resource-intensive crops, or those that work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, may reduce crop price volatility and crop supply disruptions. Additionally, entities may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can result in higher costs of capital, reduced margins and constrained revenue growth."
Food & Beverage,Agricultural Products,Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain,"Agricultural products entities source agricultural inputs from a large number of suppliers. How entities in the industry screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics may impact consumer demand, reputational risks, and the ability of entities to effectively manage their crop supply and respond to price fluctuations. Supply chain management issues related to labour, environmental practices, ethics, or corruption may result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs for entities. Similarly, agricultural products entities may face reputational damage if their suppliers perform poorly on environmental or social issues. Entities can mitigate these risks and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities by engaging with key suppliers to implement sustainable agricultural practices or source from certified suppliers. "
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Water Management,"Electricity generation is one of the most water-intensive industries in the world in terms of water withdrawals. Thermoelectric power plants—typically coal, nuclear and natural gas—use large quantities of water for cooling purposes. The industry is facing increasing water-related supply and regulatory risks, potentially requiring capital investment in technology or even creating stranded assets. As water supplies tighten in many regions—and electricity generation, agriculture and community use compete for water supplies—power plants increasingly may be unable to operate at full capacity, or at all, because of region-specific water constraints. The availability of water is an important factor to consider when calculating the future value of many electricity-generating assets and for evaluating proposals for new generation sources. Increased water scarcity—because of factors such as increasing consumption and reduced supplies resulting fromclimate change, which could result in more frequent or intense droughts—could prompt regulatory authorities to limit entities’ ability to withdraw necessary amounts of water, especially in regions with high baseline water stress. Furthermore, entities must manage the growing number of regulations related to the significant biodiversity impacts that such large withdrawals may cause. To mitigate these risks, entities can invest both in more efficient water-usage systems for plants, and place strategic priority on assessing long-term water availability, as well as water-related biodiversity risks, when siting new power plants."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Energy Resource Planning,"Electricity generation represents the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world. Mainly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, these emissions are mostly by-products of fossil fuel combustion. The transmission ordistribution (T&D) segments of the industry produce negligible emissions. Electric utility entities could face significant operating costs and capital expenditures for mitigating GHG emissions as environmental regulations become increasingly stringent. Although many of these costs may be passed to a utility’s customers, some power generators, especially in deregulated markets, may be unable to recoup these costs. Entities may reduce GHG emissions from electricity generationthrough careful infrastructure investment planning by ensuring the delivery of an energy mix capable of meeting the emissions requirements set forth by regulations, and by implementing industry-leading technologies and processes. Being proactive in cost-effectively reducing GHG emissions may create a competitive advantage for entities and mitigate unanticipated regulatory compliance costs. Failure to properly estimate capital-expenditure needs and permitting costs, or other difficulties in reducing GHG emissions, may result in significant negative effects on returns in the form of asset write-downs, the costs to obtain carbon credits, or unexpected increases in operating and capital expenditures. Regulatory emphasis on this issue may increase in the coming decades, as exemplified by the international emissions-reduction agreement made at the 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties in 2015."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,End-Use Efficiency & Demand,"Energy efficiency is a low-lifecycle-cost method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, because less electricity needs to be generated to provide the same end-use energy services. Utilities can promote energy efficiency and conservation among their customers. Such strategies may include offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherising customers’ homes, educating customers on energy-saving methods, offering incentives to customers to curb electricity use during times of peak demand (‘demand response’), or investing in technology such as smart meters, which allow customers to track their energy use. While saving consumers money, these efforts also may reduce operating costs for electric utilities by decreasing peak demand. Furthermore, depending on the utility regulatory framework, local jurisdictions may mandate that entities develop energy efficiency plans before permitting new builds. Companies with effective strategies to reduce the downside risks from demand fluctuations, may gain adequate and timely returns on needed investments. Furthermore, reducing costs through efficiency initiatives may earn higher, long-term risk-adjusted returns."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Grid Resiliency,"Electricity is critical for the continued function of most elements of modern life, from medicine to finance, creating a societal reliance on continuous service. Major disruptions to electricity infrastructure may result in potentially high societal costs. Disruptions can be caused by extreme weather events, natural disasters and cyberattacks. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events associated with climate change continues to increase, all segments of electric utilities entities—and especially major transmission and distribution (T&D) operations—will face increasing physical threats to theirinfrastructure. Extreme weather events could result in frequent or significant service disruptions, outages and require upgrade or repair of damaged or compromised equipment, all of which may add substantial costs and damage brand reputation among regulators and customers. The increased use of smart grid technology has several benefits, including strengthening the resiliency of the grid to extreme weather events. However, this technology may make the grid more vulnerable to cyberattacks, because it provides hackers more entryways into infrastructure systems. Entities must implement strategies that minimise the probability and magnitude of impacts from extreme weather events and cyberattacks. To remain competitive in the face of increasing external competition, entities must improve the reliability, resilience and quality of their infrastructure."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Air Quality,"Fuel combustion in electricity-generation operations generates hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), criteria air pollutants (CAPs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). HAPs, CAPs, and VOCs have more localised, but nonetheless significant, human health and environmental impacts compared with the global impacts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The most common and impactful are nitrogen oxides (excluding nitrous oxide), sulphur oxide, particulate matter (PM), lead, and mercury. Emissions of these localised air pollutants are often strictly regulated, creating significant risks for electricity generators. Regulatory and legal risks are higher for those entities operating near large communities. An entity’s energy-generation mix is the best indicator of its relative risk related to air quality. Harmful air emissions from operations may result in regulatory penalties that affect extraordinary expenses, higher regulatory compliance costs, and new capital expenditures to instal best-in-class control technology. In some cases, such expenditures can be prohibitive to the continuation of a facility. Entities can manage air quality concerns through internal actions to reduce emissions, as well as by working with regulators to establish priorities and incorporate risks into short- and long-term capital planning."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Nuclear Safety & Emergency Management,"Although rare, nuclear accidents can have significant human health and environmental consequences because of their severity. Owners of nuclear power plants in many regions have operated for decades without any major public safety incidents, but the occurrence of infrequent but large-magnitude incidents anywhere in the world can have major effects on the entire nuclear power industry. Entities that own and operate nuclear plants may lose their licence to operate, as well as face many other financial consequences in the event of an accident—though entities carry insurance and may have legal protections from some liabilities. Failure to comply with the safety regulations can be expensive to nuclear power operators; in extreme circumstances it may make the continued operation of the plant uneconomical. Facing potentially significant financial repercussions, both from ongoing safety compliance as well as tail risk incidents, entities that own or operate nuclear plants must be vigilant in the safety compliance, best practices and upgrades of their facilities. They also must maintain robust emergency preparedness training for their staff and a strong safety culture. These measures can reduce the probability that accidents will occur and enable an entity to effectively detect and respondto such incidents."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Workforce Health & Safety,"Employees of entities in the industry face numerous hazards in the construction and maintenance of electric transmission and distribution (T&D) lines, as well as with the various means of electricity generation. Many of these employees work for extended periods at great heights, operate heavy machinery, and face electrocution risks. While the industry has madesignificant strides in safety improvements, significant risks and opportunities remain for further improvements. The nature of the industry—as a necessity of modern life and economies, as well as commonly a societally granted monopoly—means that the actions of entities in the industry receive significant public and regulatory scrutiny. Entities need to maintain a culture of safety to ensure adequate working conditions for their workers, ensure strong operational productivity, uphold positive views from the perspective of regulators, and manage potential risks of regulatory penalties."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Coal Ash Management,"Electricity generators must safely dispose of the hazardous by-products of their operations. Coal-fired electricity generation is a major source of hazardous waste because of its by-product, coal ash. Coal ash can have a significant effect on entity value in the power-generation segment of the industry. This issue will affect entities differently, dependingon the extent to which they generate electricity from coal. Coal ash is one of the largest industrial waste streams in the world. It contains heavy metal contaminants that have been associated with cancer and other serious diseases, especially when they leach into groundwater. Coal ash can have beneficial uses when recycled or reused, such as in the creation of fly ash concrete or wallboard, creating revenue opportunities for electric utilities. Safe handling of coal ash, location of coal ash impoundments that minimise harm to human life and/or the environment, strong monitoring and containment of coal ash, and the sale for beneficial uses of coal ash are important strategies to reduce regulatory compliance costs as well as penalties for non-compliance. There can be significant litigation and/or remediation costs if the coal ash leaches into the surrounding environment."
Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,Energy Affordability,"A de facto objective of regulated electric utilities is to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity. Entities in theindustry are tasked with managing these potentially competing priorities to maintain favourable relations with customers and regulators—and ultimately to earn appropriate returns for shareholders. The affordability of energy is particularly challenging for entities to balance, as it often conflicts with other core objectives. Utility energy bills are widely perceived to be increasingly unaffordable for low-income customers (affordability is determined by both the net cost of energy bills and the underlying customer economics). Ensuring that utility bills are affordable is crucial for utilities working to build trust (intangible asset value) with regulators and customers. Quality of regulatory relations is a key value driver for utilities,and one of the more closely analysed issues by investment analysts. The willingness of regulators to grant rate requests, rate structure modifications, cost recovery, and allowed returns is a primary determinant of financial performance and investment risk. Effectively managing affordability may enable utilities to invest more capital, favourably revise rate structures, and increase allowed returns. Furthermore, utilities that do not effectively manage affordability are increasinglyexposed to customers defecting from the grid (or reducing reliance on the grid) by implementing distributed energy resources or pursuing other alternative energy sources (e.g., industrial customers’ use of combined heat and power). Managing affordability involves operating an efficient business with a well-thought-out, long-term perspective and strategy, as well as working closely with regulators and public policymakers on rate structures and, potentially, bill-assistance programs. While the precise nature of financial impacts of affordability are largely determined by utilities’ business models and rate structures, affordability is a critical business issue for utilities to manage in terms of maintaining (and growing) customer bases, building intangible asset value, creating investment and return opportunities, and ultimately delivering shareholder returns."
Services,Professional & Commercial Services,Professional Integrity,"The business model of professional and commercial services entities is dependent on the development of client trust and loyalty. To ensure long-term and mutually beneficial relationships, entities seek to provide services that satisfy the highest professional standards of the industry. Professional integrity is an important governance issue in the industry, as the collective organisation of professionals inside a single organisation can make the detection and prevention of conflicts of interest, bias, or negligence more challenging. Training employees adequately, providing advice and distributing data free from bias and error, and taking other measures to ensure professional integrity are important both for strengthening an entity’s license to operate as well as for attracting and retaining clients."
Services,Professional & Commercial Services,Workforce Diversity & Engagement,"Developing a broad base of employees that are valued, respected, and supported throughout an organisation is essential for the long-term growth prospects of professional and commercial services entities. Human capital is the major source of revenue generation, contributing knowledge, talent, advice, and various technical skills. While financial and non-financial service providers may have a high level of diversity among lower-level employees, they may still lack diversity among senior management. Enhancing workforce diversity, particularly among management positions, is likely to help entities attract and develop the best talent. High levels of employee engagement, fair treatment, and equitable levels of pay and advancement opportunities for all workers are all likely to contribute to increased productivity and performance through all levels of the entity."
Services,Professional & Commercial Services,Data Security,"Entities in every segment of the Professional & Commercial Services industry are entrusted with customer data. Employment and temporary staffing agencies as well as data providers and consulting entities store, process, and transmitincreasing amounts of sensitive personal data about employees, clients, and candidates. In addition, the clients of financial and non-financial services providers are likely to handle sensitive information and may share this information with professional and commercial services entities. The exposure of sensitive customer information through cybersecurity breaches, other malicious activities, or employee negligence may result in significant risks such as identity fraud and theft.Data breaches may compromise perception of the effectiveness of a service provider’s security measures, which could result in reputational damage and adversely impact an entity’s ability to attract and retain clients. "
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Safety & Environmental Stewardship of Chemicals,"Product safety and stewardship is a critical issue for entities in the Chemicals industry. The potential for human health or environmental impacts of chemicals during the use-phase can influence product demand and regulatory risk, which in turn can affect revenues and result in higher operating expenses, regulatory compliance costs, and mitigation. The industry can therefore mitigate regulatory risk and grow market share by developing innovative approaches to manage the potential impacts of products during the use phase, including developing alternative products with reduced toxicity. This could contribute to shareholder value through improved competitive positioning, greater market share, reduced regulatory risks, and higher brand value."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Genetically Modified Organisms,"Some chemical entities produce crop seeds developed using genetically modified organism (GMO) technology. GMO technology has improved the yields of certain crops, including corn and soy, by altering the crop’s resistance to pesticides and herbicides and improving drought tolerance, among other factors. At the same time, consumers and regulators in some areas have expressed concern over the use of GMO technology due to perceived health, environmental, and social impacts of GMO cultivation and consumption. Thus, entities that employ such technology face both market opportunitiesand risks related to its use. The adoption of GMO crop technology is significant in the U.S., while in other regions, including in the European Union and China, regulators have implemented bans, quotas, or labelling requirements on GMO-based products. Such product bans or labelling requirements may lower revenues or increase costs for manufacturers, while regulatory and public perception can affect reputational risk. As such, entities that effectively respond to market drivers related to GMO products can mitigate risks and capitalise on opportunities."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Hazardous Waste Management,"Chemical manufacturing may generate hazardous process waste, including but not limited to heavy metals, spent acids, catalysts, and wastewater treatment sludge. Entities face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste, as some wastes are subject to regulations pertaining to their transport, treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, where possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, may lower entities’ long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Water Management,"Used primarily for cooling, steam generation and feedstock processing, water is a critical input in chemicals production. Long-term historical increases in water scarcity and cost, and expectations of continued increases—because of over-consumption and reduced supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution and climate change—show the importance of water management. Water scarcity may result in a higher risk of operational disruption for entities with water-intensive operations, and can increase water procurement costs and capital expenditures. Meanwhile, chemical manufacturing may generate process wastewater that must be treated before disposal. Non-compliance with water quality regulations may result in regulatory compliance and mitigation costs or legal expenses stemming from litigation. Reducing water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies may result in lower operating costs over time and may mitigate financial effects of regulations, water supply shortages and community-related disruptions of operations."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment,"The Chemicals industry faces strict regulation governing air emissions, water discharge, chemical safety, and process safety, among other issues. Anticipating and adapting to regulatory developments, both in the short and long term, is a critical issue for the industry, as regulatory developments can significantly affect product demand, manufacturing costs, and brand value. Therefore, entities with a clear strategy for managing the regulatory environment that aligns corporate performance with sustainable environmental outcomes and accounts for societal externalities could benefit from reduced regulatory uncertainty, stronger brand value, and improved competitive positioning. "
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Chemical manufacturing generates direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel combustion in manufacturing and cogeneration processes, as well as process emissions from the chemical transformation of feedstocks. GHG emissions may result in regulatory compliance costs or penalties and operating risks for chemicals entities. However, the financial effects may vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. The industry may be subject to increasingly stringent regulations as countries try to limit or reduce emissions. Entities that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels or manufacturing process advances may benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk, among other financial benefits."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,"Operational Safety, Emergency Preparedness & Response","Health, safety, and emergency management is a critical issue for entities in the Chemicals industry. Technical failure, human error, or external factors such as weather can lead to accidental releases of chemical substances into the environment at processing facilities or during storage and transportation. Furthermore, the combustible nature of chemical substances, combined with the high operating temperatures and pressures involved in manufacturing, elevates the risk of explosions, hazardous spills, or other emergency situations. Such events can harm workers or people in nearby communities through the release of harmful air emissions and chemical substances, and may also adversely impact the environment. Entities may face operational disruptions, damage to facilities, reputational harm, and increased regulatory compliance and remediation costs in the event of a process incident. As such, strong management of process safety can reduce operational downtime, mitigate costs and regulatory risk, and ensure workforce productivity."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Air Quality,"In addition to greenhouse gases (GHGs), chemical manufacturing may produce air emissions including, sulphur dioxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). As with GHGs, these emissions typically stem from the combustion of fuels and the processing of feedstocks. Relative to other industries, the Chemicals industry is a more significant source of some of these emissions. Entities face operating costs, regulatory compliance costs, regulatory penalties in the event of non-compliance, and capital expenditures related to emissions management, while related financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing regulations. As such, active management of the issue through technological process improvements or other strategies may mitigate such impacts, improving financial performance and enhancing brand value."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Energy Management,"Chemical manufacturing is typically energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, amount consumed and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels such as natural gas and natural gas liquids are the predominant form of non-feedstock energy used, while purchased electricity also may be a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases may be a significant share of production costs. An entity’s energy mix may include energy generated on-site, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Trade-offs in the use of energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, an entity’s energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions may affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Community Relations,"Chemical entities are important economic contributors to many communities, providing employment opportunities and community development through taxes and capital generation. Meanwhile, issues including environmental policy, community health, and process safety are key issues with important regulatory, operational, financial, and reputational implications for entities. Environmental externalities including air emissions and water use can affect human health of those living near chemical facilities over the long term. Meanwhile, process safety incidents can endanger community health and safety, leading to regulatory penalties, legal action, and mitigation costs. Consequently, chemicals entities can benefit from building strong relationships with communities in order to mitigate potential operating disruption, reduce regulatory risk, retain top employees, lower the risk of litigation expenses in the event of process safety incidents, and ensure a strong social license to operate. Entities can adopt various community engagement strategies, such as developing community engagement plans, establishing codes and guidelines to ensure alignment of the organisation’s interests with those of their surrounding communities, or conducting impact assessments to evaluate projects and mitigate potential adverse impacts. "
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Product Design for Use-phase Efficiency,"As increasing resource scarcity and regulations encourage greater materials efficiency and lower energy consumption and emissions, the Chemicals industry may benefit from developing products that enhance customer efficiency. From reducingautomobile emissions through materials optimisation to improving building insulation performance, Chemicals industry products can enhance efficiency across many applications. Entities that develop cost-effective solutions to meet customer demand for improved efficiency may benefit from increased revenue and market share, stronger competitive positioning and enhanced brand value."
Resource Transformation,Chemicals,Workforce Health & Safety,"Employees in chemicals manufacturing facilities face health and safety risks from exposure to heavy machinery, harmful substances, high temperatures and pressure, and electrical hazards, among others. Creating an effective safety culture is critical to proactively mitigate safety impacts, which could result in financial consequences, including higher healthcare costs, litigation, and work disruption. By maintaining a safe work environment and promoting a culture of safety, entities can minimise safety-related expenses and potentially improve productivity. "
Resource Transformation,Electrical & Electronic Equipment,Product Safety,"The proper and safe functioning of electrical and electronic equipment is an important issue because of potential risks to customers, including electrical fires. In the event of a product safety incident, entities could be exposed to product liabilityclaims, revenue loss due to damaged reputation, redesign costs, recalls, litigation, or fines. Proper safety procedures, tests,and protocols for products can help entities reduce the risk of such adverse impacts and strengthen an entity’s brand. "
Resource Transformation,Electrical & Electronic Equipment,Hazardous Waste Management,"Electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing may generate hazardous waste, including but not limited to heavy metals and wastewater treatment sludge. Entities face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste, as somewastes are subject to regulations pertaining to their transport, treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, where possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, can lower entities’ long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties. "
Resource Transformation,Electrical & Electronic Equipment,Materials Sourcing,"Electrical and electronic equipment entities are exposed to supply chain risks when critical materials are used in products. Entities in the industry manufacture products using critical materials with few or no available substitutes, many of which are sourced from deposits concentrated in only a few countries which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Entities in this industry also face competition due to increasing global demand for these materials from other sectors, which can result in price increases and supply risks. Entities that are able to limit the use of critical materials through use of alternatives, as well as secure their supply, can mitigate the potential for financial impacts stemming from supply disruptions and volatile input prices."
Resource Transformation,Electrical & Electronic Equipment,Energy Management,"Electrical and electronic equipment entities may use significant amounts of energy. Purchased electricity is the largest share of energy expenditure in the industry, followed by purchased fuels. The type of energy used, amount consumed andenergy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. Including the use of electricity generated on site, grid-sourced electricity and alternative energy, an entity’s energy mix may be important in reducing the cost and increasing the reliability of energy supply and, ultimately, affecting the entity’s cost structure and exposure to regulatory shifts."
Resource Transformation,Electrical & Electronic Equipment,Product Lifecycle Management,"Electrical and electronic equipment entities face increasing challenges and opportunities associated with environmental and social externalities that may stem from the use of their products. Regulations are incentivising entities to reduce or eliminate the use of harmful chemicals in their products. To a lesser extent, regulations and customers are encouraging entities to reduce the environmental footprint of their products in the use-phase, primarily in terms of energy intensity. Electrical and electronic equipment entities that develop cost-effective products and energy efficiency solutions may benefit from increased revenue and market share, stronger competitive positioning and enhanced brand value. Similarly, products with reduced chemical safety concerns may provide opportunities for increased market share."
Resource Transformation,Electrical & Electronic Equipment,Business Ethics,"Electrical and electronic equipment manufacturers may be vulnerable to regulatory scrutiny of business ethics because of their operations in regions with weaker government enforcement of business ethics laws. Entities in this industry have been found in violation of corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as anti-competitive behaviour. Unethical practices may jeopardise future revenue growth due to reputational risks and can result in significant legal costs and a higher risk profile. As such, strong governance practices can mitigate the riskof violations of business ethics laws and resulting regulatory penalties or brand-value impacts. "
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Product Safety,"Container and packaging product safety is a critical factor for the industry as many products are used in consumer-facing applications including in the food and health care industries. Aspects of packaging safety include physical hazards and thepresence of chemical substances. In the event of a product safety incident, products may be recalled or require redesign, possibly increasing costs to the manufacturer and resulting in reduced revenue and adverse impacts to brand value. As such, entities that proactively manage product safety risks can enhance their brand reputation and reduce the risk of adverse financial impacts."
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The Containers & Packaging industry generates direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel combustion in manufacturing and cogeneration processes. GHG emissions may result in regulatory compliance costs or penalties and operating risks for entities. However, the financial effects may vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. The industry may be subject to increasingly stringent regulations as countries try to limit or reduce emissions. Entities that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels or manufacturing process advances could benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk, among other financial benefits."
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Supply Chain Management,"Containers and packaging manufacturing uses large quantities of raw materials including wood fibre and aluminium. Sustainable production of these materials is an important supply chain consideration for entities in the industry because adverse environmental impacts could increase materials costs and affect the brand value of entities. To mitigate such risks,entities may implement supply chain vetting practices and implement third-party standards within internal operations and suppliers that certify that the materials were produced in a sustainable manner. Additionally, such actions may raise brandvalue and meet customer demand for sustainably produced packaging products, providing access to new markets and growth opportunities."
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Water Management,"Containers and packaging manufacturing requires water for various stages of production including in raw materials processing, process cooling and steam generation at on site cogeneration plants. Long-term historical increases in water scarcity and cost, and expectations of continued increases—because of over-consumption and reduced supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution and climate change—show the importance of water management. Water scarcity may result in a higher risk of operational disruption for entities with water-intensive operations, and can increase water procurement costs and capital expenditures. Meanwhile, containers and packaging manufacturing may generate process wastewater that must be treated before disposal. Non-compliance with water quality regulations may result in regulatory compliance and mitigation costs or legal expenses stemming from litigation. Reducing water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies may result in lower operating costs over time and may mitigate financial effects of regulations, water supply shortages and community-related disruptions of operations."
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Air Quality,"In addition to greenhouse gases (GHGs), containers and packaging manufacturing may produce air emissions, including, but not limited to, sulphur dioxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). As with GHGs, these emissions typically stem from the combustion of fuels to produce energy. Relative to other industries, the Containers & Packaging industry is a significant source of some of these emissions. Entities face operating costs, regulatory compliance costs, regulatory penalties in the event of non-compliance, and capital expenditures related to emissions management, while related financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing regulations. As such,active management of the issue through technological process improvements or other strategies can mitigate such impacts, improving financial performance and enhancing brand value."
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Energy Management,"Containers and packaging manufacturing is energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, amount consumed and energy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels such as natural gas and biomass are the predominant form of energy used, while purchased electricity also may be a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases may be a significant share of production costs. An entity’s energy mix may include energy generated on site, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Trade-offs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such,an entity’s energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions may affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time."
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Product Lifecycle Management,"Containers and packaging entities face opportunities and challenges associated with the potential environmental impacts of their products throughout their lifecycle. Designing products with reduced use-phase and end-of-life environmental impacts is an important opportunity for manufacturers. Demand for packaging produced with safe chemicals and using recycled and renewable materials continues to grow, along with demand for recyclable, reusable, and compostable products. While the lifecycle impact of products depends largely on their use and disposal, entities that can effectively optimise such attributes during the design phase may gain a competitive advantage. "
Resource Transformation,Containers & Packaging,Waste Management,"Containers and packaging manufacturing may generate hazardous process waste which may include heavy metals, spent acids, catalysts and wastewater treatment sludge. Entities face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste because some wastes are subject to regulations pertaining to its transport, treatment, storage and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, if possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, may reduce an entity’s long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties."
Financials,Asset Management & Custody Activities,Financed Emissions,"Entities participating in asset management activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissions associated with those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher emissions might be more susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change which in turn can impact the prospects of a financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise through related technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in asset management activities are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This measurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how it might need to adapt its investment strategies over time."
Financials,Asset Management & Custody Activities,Employee Diversity & Inclusion,"Asset management and custody activities entities face a high degree of competition for skilled employees. At the same time, the industry has a low level of diversity, especially among senior roles. In recent years, considerable media attention has been focused on cases of gender discrimination involving publicly listed entities in the industry. As the industry continues to undergo rapid innovation through the introduction of more complex financial products and computerised algorithmic and high-frequency trading, the ability of entities to attract and retain skilled employees will likely be increasingly material. By ensuring gender and racial diversity throughout the organisation, entities are likely to expand their candidate pools, which could lower hiring costs and improve operational efficiency. Further, evidence suggests that diverse groups of employees at asset management entities may enhance the risk-return characteristics of investment portfolios. Enhanced disclosure regarding employee gender and racial/ethnic diversity, especially when provided by employee category, will allow shareholders to assess how entities in this industry are managing the associated risks and opportunities. "
Financials,Asset Management & Custody Activities,Business Ethics,"The regulatory environment surrounding the Asset Management & Custody Activities industry continues to evolve both nationally and internationally. Entities are required to adhere to a complex and often inconsistent set of rules relating to performance and conduct as well as disclosure on issues including insider trading, clearing requirements in over-the-counter derivatives markets, and tax evasion. Asset management and custody activities entities are also subject to strict legal requirements as fiduciaries or custodians of their clients. Finally, in some jurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistleblowers may lead to an increase in the number of complaints brought to regulators. Firms that are able to ensure regulatory compliance through robust internal controls will be better positioned to build trust with clients, leading to increased revenue, and to protect shareholder value by minimising losses incurred as a result of legal proceedings."
Financials,Asset Management & Custody Activities,Factors in Investment Management & Advisory,"Asset Management & Custody Activities entities maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients. These entities must consider and incorporate an analysis of all material information into investment decisions, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. The process of ESG investment involves consideration of ESG factors in valuation, modelling, portfolio construction, proxy voting and engagement with investees and, as a result, in investment decision-making by asset and wealth managers. As the management and use of non-financial forms of capital increasingly contribute to market value, incorporation of ESG factors in the analysis of investees has become more relevant. Research has established that an entity’s management of some ESG factors may impact materially both its accounting and market returns. Therefore, deep understanding of investees’ ESG performance, integration of ESG factors in valuation and modelling, as well as engagement with investees on sustainability issues allows asset managers to generate superior returns. On the other hand, asset management and custody activities industry entities that fail to consider these risks and opportunities in their investment management activities may witness diminished investment portfolio returns that may result in reduced performance fees. Over the long term, these failures could result in an outflow of assets under management (AUM), the loss of market share and lower management fees."
Financials,Asset Management & Custody Activities,Transparent Information & Fair Advice for Customers,"Asset managers have legal obligations and fiduciary duties related to record keeping, operating and marketing, disclosure requirements, and prohibition of fraudulent activities. Regulations surrounding the Asset Management & Custody Activities industry are intended to align the interests of entities and their clients and to limit conflicts of interest. This alignment, coupled with the fact that most asset managers earn fees based on the amount of assets under management,provides a significant incentive for entities to provide clients with strategies that match their risk-return profiles. Despite required disclosures, entities still face significant challenges in ensuring that clients understand the nature of risks taken ininvestment strategies. Failure to provide services that satisfy customer expectations may result in lengthy and costly litigation, diminished trust with clients, and lower sales as a result. Enhanced disclosure on procedures or programs to provide adequate, clear, and transparent information about products and services, the regulatory violation record of employees, and the amount of fines and settlements associated with professional integrity will provide investors with an advanced understanding of how well entities manage risks associated with this issue and whether they are able to preserve long-term value for shareholders. "
Infrastructure,Real Estate,Climate Change Adaptation,"Climate change affects entities in the industry via frequent or high-impact extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. How an entity structures its business model to incorporate assessments of climate change risks, and the adaptation to such risks, may increasingly be relevant to entity value over the long-term. More specifically, investment strategies with assets located on floodplains and in coastal regions exposed to inclement weather may require increased risk mitigation and business model adaptation to long-term climate change. These strategies are especially important considering the long-term challenges associated with flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidised flood insurance programs, and financing stipulations or other creditor concerns. Besides insurance, other risk mitigation measures include improvements to physical asset resiliency and lease terms that transfer risk to tenants, although these measures can create their own costs and risks for real estate entities. To ensure long-term growth, entities must implement comprehensive climate change adaptation strategies, account for trade-offs between various risk mitigation strategies, and integrate all projected cost and benefit considerations over the long-term."
Infrastructure,Real Estate,Management of Tenant Sustainability Impacts,"Real estate assets generate significant sustainability impacts, including resource consumption (energy and water), waste generation and impacts on occupant health through indoor environmental quality. While entities own real estate assets, the tenant operations of such assets dominate the sustainability impacts produced by the built environment. Tenants may design and construct leased spaces according to their operating needs. In turn, their operations consume significant amounts of energy and water, generate waste, and impact the health of those living, working, shopping, or visiting the properties. While these sustainability impacts often are often generated by tenant operations and activities, real estate owners play an important role in influencing tenant sustainability impacts. The way entities in the industry structure their agreements, contracts and relationships with tenants may be instrumental in managing the sustainability impacts of their tenants effectively, and ultimately, the impacts of their assets. Managing tenant sustainability impacts may include mitigating the problem of split incentives by aligning both parties’ financial interests with sustainability outcomes, establishing systematic measurement and communication of resource consumption data, creating shared performance goals, and mandating minimum sustainability performance or design requirements, among other strategies. Effective management of tenant sustainability impacts, particularly related to energy, water and indoor environmental quality, may drive asset value appreciation, increase tenant demand and satisfaction, decrease direct operating costs, or decrease risks related to building codes and regulations."
Infrastructure,Real Estate,Energy Management,"Real estate assets consume significant amounts of energy for space heating, ventilating, air conditioning, water heating, lighting and using equipment and appliances. The type and magnitude of energy used and strategies for energy management are dependent upon the real estate asset class, among other factors. Generally, grid electricity is the predominant form of consumed energy, though on-site fuel combustion and renewable energy production also serve important roles. Energy costs may be borne by entities or property occupants; either way, energy management is a significant industry issue. To the extent that the real estate owner assumes direct responsibility for energy costs, such costsoften represent significant operating costs, indicating the importance of energy management. Energy pricing volatility anda general trend of electricity price increases, energy-related regulations, potentially wide variations in energy performance in existing building stock, and opportunities for efficiency improvements through economically attractive capital investments all show the importance of energy management. Energy costs assumed by occupants, either in whole or in part, are nonetheless likely to affect entities through various channels. Building energy performance is a notable driver of tenant demand, because it allows them to control operating costs, mitigate potential environmental impacts, and, often just as importantly, maintain a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to energy-related regulations even if energy costs are the occupants’ responsibility. Overall, entities that effectively manage asset energy performance may realise reduced operating costs and regulatory risks, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Improving energy performance is dependent upon property type and location, target tenant market, local building codes, physical and legal opportunitiesto deploy distributed renewable energy, the ability to measure consumption, and existing building stock, among other factors."
Infrastructure,Real Estate,Water Management,"Buildings consume significant amounts of water in their operations, through water fixtures, building equipment, appliances and irrigation. Water consumption operating costs may be significant depending on property type, tenant operations, geographical locations and other factors. Entities can be responsible for a building’s water costs, or common area water costs, though entities commonly allocate all, or a portion, of these costs to occupants. In these arrangements, water management through tenant demand and regulatory exposure continues to be important. Tenants may assess real estate asset water efficiency to control operating costs, mitigate environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, develop a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may comply with water-related regulations even if water costs are the occupants’ responsibility. Overall, entities that effectively manage asset water efficiency, even if they bear no direct water costs, may realise reduced operating costs and regulatory exposure, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Long-term historic water expense increases and expectations of continued increases because of overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution and climate change show the importance of water management. Improving asset water efficiency is dependent upon the property type, water availability, target tenant market, local building codes, the ability to measure consumption and the existing buildingstock, among other factors."
Consumer Goods,E-Commerce,Product Packaging & Distribution,"A significant part of the E-Commerce industry’s added value comes from an entity’s ability to move a wide array of goods efficiently to consumers who would otherwise have to personally travel to collect the goods from brick-and-mortar stores.As the volume of packaging shipments increases, the industry may become more exposed to environmental externalities, such as carbon pricing and rising fuel costs that present risks associated with the shipping of products. While entities that outsource shipping and logistics have less control over the specific processes of shipping operations, they still can select suppliers with more energy-efficient business practices. Because this is a highly competitive and low-margin industry, the ability to reduce shipping costs through fuel reduction and more efficient routing may permit entities to pass those savings on to their customers. E-commerce entities also have an incentive to minimise the use of packaging. Efficient packaging can decrease costs by reducing the amount of purchased packaging material, as well as saving logistics costs because more products may fit into a single shipping load."
Consumer Goods,E-Commerce,Hardware Infrastructure Energy & Water Management,"The E-Commerce industry uses a large part of the energy it consumes to power critical hardware and IT infrastructure in data centres. Data centres must be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the disruption magnitude and timing. Entities also face a trade-off between energy and water consumption for their data centre cooling needs. Cooling data centres with water instead of chillers improves energy efficiency, but this method can result in dependence on potentially scarce local water resources. Entities that effectively manage this issue may benefit from cost savings and minimise reputational risks, because concerns over energyand water use are growing."
Consumer Goods,E-Commerce,Data Privacy & Advertising Standards,"E-commerce entities have access to consumer information, including financial information, purchase history, and basic demographic data. Entities in this industry must carefully manage two separate and often conflicting priorities. On one hand, entities compete on their ability to leverage data to provide users with relevant services and target advertising or product recommendations based on consumers’ preferences and behaviour patterns. On the other hand, the fact that entities have access to a wide range of user data, such as personal, demographic, and behavioural data, raises privacy concerns among users and the public at large, and is leading to increased regulatory scrutiny from authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions. Failure to manage the issue can result in costs associated with regulatory oversight and reputational risks. Furthermore, effective management in this area can have financial implications through increased user confidence and loyalty, which are particularly important to maintain market share."
Consumer Goods,E-Commerce,"Employee Recruitment, Inclusion & Performance","Employees are key contributors to value creation in the E-Commerce industry. While the number of job openings in the industry continues to grow, entities are finding it difficult to recruit qualified employees to fill these positions. In key markets, a shortage of technically skilled domestic workers has created intense competition to acquire such employees, contributing to high turnover rates. This competition for talent and the search for innovation opportunities presents several interrelated sustainability challenges regarding human capital that entities must manage. Hiring foreign nationals to compensate for shortages in local talent can create risks related to perceived social implications in the host and home countries of workers. Entities offer significant monetary and nonmonetary benefits to improve employee engagement and, therefore, retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve employee engagement and work-life balance might influence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce. As the industry is characterised by relatively low representation from women and minority groups, efforts to recruit from and develop diverse talent pools can serve to address the talent shortage and generally to improve the value of entity offerings. Greater workforce diversity is importantfor innovation, and it helps entities understand the needs of their diverse and global customer base."
Consumer Goods,E-Commerce,Data Security,"The business model of entities in the E-Commerce industry depend on a firm’s ability to securely process electronic payments. As consumers become more educated about the threats of cybercrime, particularly in the wake of continued high-profile attacks, having a reputation as a secure entity will become increasingly important to maintain or gain market share. There is an opportunity for the most trusted brands to position themselves favourably in the eyes of consumers andgain a significant competitive advantage. This makes user loyalty, which is highly influenced by the perception of the safety of the user’s valuable financial and personal information, particularly important to maintaining market share."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Exploration & Production (E&P) activities generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a variety of sources. Emissions may be combusted, including those arising from flaring or power generation equipment, or uncombusted, including those emissions arising from gas processing equipment, venting, flaring and fugitive methane. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to climate change related risks may result in additional regulatorycompliance costs and risks for E&P entities. With natural gas production from shale resources expanding, the management of the emission of methane, a highly potent GHG, from oil and gas E&P systems has emerged as a major operational, reputational and regulatory risk for entities. Furthermore, the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources may be more or less GHG-intensive than conventional oil and gas, with associated effects on regulatory risk. Energy efficiency, use of less carbon-intensive fuels, or process improvements to reduce fugitive emissions, venting and flaring, can provide direct benefits to E&P entities in the form of reduced costs or increased revenue."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Water Management,"Depending on the extraction technique, exploration and production operations may consume significant quantities of water, which may expose entities to the risk of reduced water availability, regulations limiting use, or related cost increases, particularly in water-stressed regions. Contamination of local water resources can result from incidents involvingproduced water, flowback water, hydraulic fracturing fluids and other well fluids. Historically, the possible impacts of hydraulic fracturing operations and the risk of groundwater supply contamination have raised concerns. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling, other water management strategies, and use of non-toxic fracturing fluids could create operational efficiency for entities and reduce their operating costs. Such strategies could also minimise the effects that regulations, water supply shortages and community-related disruptions have on operations."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment,"The Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production industry is subject to numerous sustainability-related regulations and an often rapidly changing regulatory environment. Changes to the legal and regulatory environment may result in material impactson shareholder value. Entities in the industry regularly participate in the regulatory and legislative process on a wide variety of environmental and societal issues, and may do so directly or through representation by an industry association. Such engagement can result from entities seeking to ensure industry views are represented in the development of regulations impacting the industry as well as to represent shareholder interests. At the same time, such engagement to influence environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect entities’ reputations with stakeholders and ultimately impact the entity’s social license to operate. Entities that are able to balance these viewpoints may be better positioned to respond to medium- to long-term regulatory developments.."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Business Ethics & Transparency,"Managing business ethics and maintaining an appropriate level of transparency in payments to governments or individuals are significant issues for the exploration and production (E&P) entities. This is due to the importance of government relations to entities’ ability to conduct business in this industry and to gain access to oil and gas reserves. Theemergence of several anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and payments-transparency laws and initiatives globally create regulatory mechanisms to reduce certain risks. Violations of these could lead to significant one-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs, whereas successful compliance with such regulations could provide risk mitigation opportunities and avoid adverse outcomes. Enforcement of these laws could lead to significant one-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs and even affect an entity’s social license to operate. Entities with significant reserves or operations in corruption-prone countries could face heightened risks. Entities are under pressure to ensure that their governance structures and business practices can address corruption and willful or unintentional participation in illegal or unethical payments or gifts to government officials or private persons."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Biodiversity Impacts,"The exploration and production (E&P) industry’s activities can have significant impacts on biodiversity. Examples include habitat loss and alteration through land use for exploration, production, disposing of drilling and associated wastes, and decommissioning of onshore and offshore wells. Oil spills and leaks are a threat to species and habitats impacted by hydrocarbon contamination. Biodiversity impacts of E&P operations can affect the valuation of oil and gas reserves and create operational risks. The environmental characteristics of the land where reserves are located could increase extractioncosts as a result of increasing awareness and protection of ecosystems, making such reserves uneconomical to extract. Entities could also face regulatory or reputational barriers to accessing reserves in ecologically sensitive areas. This may include new protection statuses afforded to areas where reserves are located. Areas such as the Arctic and certain shorelines with mangroves and swamps are not only extremely ecologically sensitive, but also entail more complex and expensive cleanup operations if hydrocarbon spills or leaks occur there. Negative future impacts on the value of reserves could be mitigated by taking into consideration the location of reserves in or near protected areas when making investment or capital expenditure decisions. Entities with a good track record of minimising biodiversity impacts could gain a competitive advantage in accessing new reserves in or near protected areas. Ongoing E&P operations could be at risk in the absence of effective environmental management plans for different stages of the project lifecycle, due to regulatory penalties, litigation, community protests, and associated costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Air Quality,"Air emissions from E&P operations other than greenhouse gas emissions include hazardous air pollutants, criteria air pollutants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can have significant, localised human health and environmental impacts. Of particular concern are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and VOC emissions. The financial impacts on entities from air emissions will vary depending on the specific locations of operations and the prevailing air emissions regulations. As E&P operations expand close to population centres, the impacts on human health are likely to be exacerbated if air emissions limits are breached. Active management of the issue—through technological and process improvements—could allow entities to limit the impact of regulations in an environment of increasing regulatory and public concerns about air quality. Entities could benefit from operational efficiencies that may lead to a lower cost structure over time."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Community Relations,"Exploration and production (E&P) activities take place over a number of years, and entities may be involved in multiple projects in a region that can have a wide range of community impacts. Community rights and interests may be affected by environmental and social impacts of E&P operations, such as competition for access to local energy or water resources,air and water emissions, and waste from operations. E&P entities frequently need support from local communities to be able to obtain permits and leases and conduct their activities without disruptions. Entities may experience adverse financial impacts if the community interferes, or lobbies its government to interfere, with the rights of an E&P entity in relation to their ability to access, develop, and produce reserves. In addition to community concerns about the direct impacts of projects, the presence of E&P activities may result in associated socioeconomic impacts related to education, health, livelihoods, and food security for the community. E&P entities that are perceived as engaging in rent-seeking and exploiting a country or community’s resources without providing any socioeconomic benefits in return may be exposed to the risk of resource nationalism actions by host governments and communities. These could include imposition of ad hoc taxes and export restrictions. These risks may vary depending on the country, and could be higher in countries heavily reliant on oil and gas for their economic growth. Entities in the extractives industries can adopt various community engagement strategies in their global operations to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights andinterests, such as integrating community engagement into each phase of the project cycle. Entities are beginning to adopta “shared value” approach to provide a key socioeconomic benefit to the community while allowing the entity to profitably operate."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Reserves Valuation & Capital Expenditures,"Exploration and production (E&P) entities may be unable to extract a significant proportion of their proved and probable oil and gas reserves if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are controlled to limit global temperature increases. Entities with more carbon-intensive reserves and production and higher capital costs may face greater risks. Regulatory limits on GHG emissions, together with improved competitiveness of alternative energy technologies, could reduce global demand growth, and therefore reduce prices for oil and gas products. Extraction costs could increase with regulations that put a price on GHG emissions. These factors could affect the economic viability of oil and gas reserves. Regulatory actions that are more abrupt than anticipated, or those focusing on industries with high emissions, could impair asset values over a short period. Stewardship of capital resources and production decisions that consider near- and long-term trends related to climate change may mitigate potential asset impairment and maintain profitability and creditworthiness."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Workforce Health & Safety,"Workers involved in exploration and production (E&P) activities face significant health and safety risks due to the harsh working environments and the hazards of handling oil and gas. In addition to acute impacts resulting from accidents, workers may develop chronic health conditions, including those caused by silica or dust inhalation, as well as mental health problems. A significant proportion of the workforce at oil and gas drilling sites consists of temporary workers and employees of Oil and Gas Services entities. Therefore, health impacts on, and the safety performance of, such workers also have impacts on E&P entities. Additional health and safety protocols may be needed to protect women and minorities, particularly when they operate in regions where they continue to face discrimination."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,Critical Incident Risk Management,"The exploration and production (E&P) industry faces significant hazards associated with exploration, development, and production activities. Releases of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances as a result of accidents can also have significant consequences for an entity’s workforce, as well as external social and environmental consequences. In addition to effective process safety management practices, entities frequently prioritise developing a culture of safety to reduce theprobability that accidents and other health and safety incidents will occur. If accidents and other emergencies do occur, entities with a strong safety culture are often able to more effectively detect and respond to such incidents. A culture thatengages and empowers employees and contractors to work with management to safeguard their own health, safety, andwell-being and prevent accidents is likely to help entities reduce production downtime, mitigate costs, ensure workforce productivity, and maintain their license to operate."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production,"Security, Human Rights & Rights of Indigenous Peoples","Exploration and production (E&P) entities face additional community-related risks when operating in conflict zones; in areas with weak or absent governance institutions, rule of law, and legislation to protect human rights; or in areas with vulnerable communities such as indigenous peoples. Entities using private or government security forces to protect their workers and assets may knowingly or unknowingly contribute to human rights violations, including use of excessive force.Indigenous people are often the most vulnerable sections of the population, with limited capacity to defend their unique rights and interests. Entities perceived as contributing to human rights violations or failing to account for indigenous peoples’ rights may be affected due to protests, riots, or suspension of permits. They could face substantial costs related to compensation or settlement payments and write-downs in the value of their reserves in such areas. In the absence of country laws to address such cases, several international instruments have emerged to provide guidelines for entities, including obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for decisions that affect them. With greater awareness, several countries are also beginning to implement specific laws protecting indigenous peoples’ rights, creating increasing regulatory risk for entities."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Product Safety,"Driving is a risky activity, as distracted driving, speeding, drunk driving, and dangerous weather conditions, among other factors, can lead to accidents that expose drivers, passengers, and bystanders to possible injuries and deaths. Accidents can also be caused by defective parts in vehicles, and failure to detect defects before vehicles are sold can have significantfinancial repercussions for both automobile and auto parts manufacturers. Ensuring vehicle safety and responding in a timely manner when defects are identified can protect auto parts entities from regulatory action or customer lawsuits, which might otherwise result in significant costs. It can also help them retain their relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which often select Tier 1 suppliers based on their safety performance and reliability. As cars incorporate more sophisticated electronics and other technologies, the risks related to recalls may increase. Through effective management of product safety, auto parts entities can enhance their reputation and drive higher sales over the long term."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Materials Sourcing,"Entities in the Auto Parts industry commonly rely on rare earth metals and other critical materials as key inputs for finishedproducts. Many of these inputs have few or no available substitutes and are often sourced from deposits concentrated in few countries, many of which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Other sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry’s supply chain operates are also increasingly shaping the industry’s ability to source materials. Additionally, increased competition for these materials due to growing global demand from other sectors can result in price increases and supply risks. These materials play a crucial role in clean energy technologies, such as electric and hybrid vehicles. As regulators aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and consumer demand grows for more fuel-efficient vehicles, the share of hybrids and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) produced by the Automobiles industry is likely to continue to increase in the future. Entities that are able to limit the use of critical materials, secure their sourcing, and develop alternatives will protect themselves from supply disruptions and volatile input prices, which may impact their margins, risk profile, and cost of capital."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Energy Management,"Most energy consumed in the automobile manufacturing process occurs in the supply chain. Auto parts manufacturers use electricity and fossil fuels in their production processes, resulting in direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Purchased electricity is a majority of the energy used in the Auto Parts industry. Sustainability initiatives such as incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy are making alternative sources of energy more cost competitive. Regulators and consumers also are encouraging the industry to reduce GHG emissions. While managing the cost and risksassociated with overall energy efficiency, reliance on various types of energy and access to alternative energy sources may become increasingly important."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Competitive Behaviour,"Competitive business practices are an important governance issue for entities in the Auto Parts industry. Although industry concentration is low, there is a wide range of auto parts, and competition for business within each category of parts may not be robust. Thus, leading producers of any specific auto part may wield substantial market power in that segment, creating antitrust concerns. Collusion and price fixing by auto parts manufacturers ultimately leads to costs being passed on to consumers through higher vehicle prices. If involvement in such activities is discovered, the imposed penalties and reputational damage may have an acute impact on an entity’s valuation and balance sheet."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Design for Fuel Efficiency,"Automobile manufacturers increasingly are demanding motor parts and components that reduce vehicle fuel consumption. Fuel-efficient components and parts are critical in reducing automobile tailpipe emissions through energy efficiency gains and weight reductions, among other factors. Auto parts entities that design and manufacture such parts may increase sales to auto manufacturers that increasingly are facing stricter environmental regulations and customer preferences for more environmentally friendly cars."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Materials Efficiency,"Millions of vehicles worldwide reach the end of their useful lives every year. At the same time, the rate of vehicle ownership is expanding globally, leading to more end-of-life vehicles. To lower the lifecycle impact of vehicles, auto parts manufacturers can design their parts to be easily recyclable and reusable and can apply modularity principles to product design. They can also create take-back programs to ensure safe disposal and reuse of the products. Given input price volatility and resource constraints, auto parts entities that manage materials efficiency are likely to improve their long-term operational efficiency and strengthen their risk profile. In addition, entities can potentially reduce their manufacturing costs by using fewer materials and/or recycling materials, which will improve margins."
Transportation,Auto Parts,Waste Management,"Manufacturing auto parts involves the use of significant amounts of materials (including steel, iron, aluminium, and plastics, among others). Types of waste generated by the industry include machine lubricants and coolants, aqueous and solvent cleaning systems, paint, and scrap metals and plastics. A significant portion of auto parts manufacturers’ revenue is spent on the cost of materials. Therefore, entities that are able to manage their manufacturing inputs through reducing and recycling waste are likely to be better protected from price volatility and the risk of supply disruptions. Moreover, autoparts manufacturers can achieve savings and improve operational efficiency by increasing the amount of waste that is recycled. At the same time, auto parts manufacturers that cause negative environmental impacts through their waste management practices are likely to face regulatory oversight. Violation of environmental regulations is likely to generate legal expenses as well as capital expenditures for pollution-control facilities and occupational safety and health projects."
Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,Integrity of Gas Delivery Infrastructure,"Operating a vast network of gas pipelines, equipment and storage facilities requires a multifaceted, long-term approach to ensuring infrastructure integrity and managing related risks. Although customers depend on reliable gas supplies, entities manage substantial risks—including those related to human health, property and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—that result from operating gas distribution networks and related infrastructure. Ageing infrastructure, inadequate monitoring and maintenance, and other operational factors may result in gas leaks. Gas leak safety-related risks, such as losses of containment, may result in fires or explosions that can be particularly dangerous in urban areas where entities often operate. Furthermore, gas leaks also result in fugitive emissions (methane), causing adverse environmental impacts. Regulated gas utilities generally incur no direct costs for gas leaks, because the cost of gas typically is passed on to customers (though this may vary by region). However, gas leaks that result in safety-related risks or fugitive emissions may affect entities financially through a variety of regulatory, legal and product demand channels. Accidents, particularly fatal accidents, may result in negligence claims against entities, leading to costly court battles and fines. GHG emissions may result in increased regulatory scrutiny—a critical element directly connected to financial performance, given the importance of regulatory relations—and potential fines and penalties. Importantly, regulated gas utilities can financially benefit from capital investment opportunities to improve performance and mitigate risks related to safety and emissions, which can be factored into their rate base. Entities manage such risks through pipeline replacements, regular inspections and monitoring, employee training and emergency preparedness, investments in technology, and other strategies such as working closely with regulators. In response to concerns about ageing infrastructure, many entities are seeking ways to expedite the replacement permitting and approval process, especially in cases where pipelines are located near densely populated areas."
Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,Energy Affordability,"A de facto objective of regulated gas utilities is to deliver natural gas to customers in a safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible manner. Entities in the industry are tasked with managing these potentially competing priorities to maintain favourable relations with customers and regulators—and ultimately to earn appropriate returns for shareholders. The affordability of energy, from the utility customer perspective, is particularly challenging to balance, as it often conflicts with other core objectives. Utility energy bills are widely perceived to be increasingly more expensive for low income customers (affordability is determined by both the net cost of energy bills and the underlying economics of customers). Playing a role in ensuring that utility bills are affordable is crucial for utilities in building trust (intangible asset value) with regulators and customers. Quality of regulatory relations is a key value driver for utilities, and one of the more closely analysed issues by investment analysts. Regulators’ willingness, or lack thereof, to grant rate requests, rate structure modifications, cost recovery, and allowed returns is a primary determinant of financial performance and investment risk. Effectively managing affordability may give utilities the opportunity to invest more capital, favourably revise rate structures, and increase allowed returns. Furthermore, utilities that do not effectively manage affordability are increasinglyexposed to customers obtaining energy supplies from means other than natural gas (or reducing energy needs) by pursuing alternative energy sources (e.g., industrial customers’ use of combined heat and power). Managing affordability involves operating an efficient business with a well-thought-out, long-term perspective and strategy, as well as working closely with regulators and public policymakers on rate structures and, potentially, bill-assistance programs. While the precise nature of financial impacts of affordability are largely determined by utility business models and rate structures, affordability is a critical business issue for utilities to manage in terms of maintaining (and growing) customer bases, building intangible asset value, creating investment and return opportunities, and ultimately delivering shareholder returns."
Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,End-Use Efficiency,"Natural gas produces fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than other fossil fuels. Expanding its use in the economy may be an important strategy for many governments and regulators striving to reduce GHG emissions. However, despite the relatively lower emissions, the natural gas value chain still produces meaningful levels of GHG emissions overall. As policymakers and regulators seek to mitigate climate change, the efficient consumption of natural gas will be an important long-term theme. Energy efficiency is a low-lifecycle-cost method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Utilities can offer customers a wide range of options to promote energy efficiency, including providing rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherising customers’ homes and educating customers on energy saving methods. Overall, entitiesthat sponsor efficiency initiatives may reduce the downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain returns on needed investments, decrease operating costs and earn higher risk-adjusted returns over the long term."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Distribution Network Efficiency,"Water utilities develop, maintain and operate complex interconnected infrastructure networks that include extensive pipelines, canals, reservoirs and pump stations. Distribution networks may lose significant volumes of water (called ‘non-revenue water’ because it is a distributed volume of water not reflected in customer billings). This water is lost primarily because of infrastructure failures and inefficiencies, such as leaking pipes and service connections. Non-revenue real waterlosses may impact financial performance, raise customer rates, and squander water and other resources such as energy and treatment chemicals. Conversely, improvements to infrastructure and operating processes may limit non-revenue losses, increase revenue and reduce costs. Efficiently directing operational and maintenance expenses or capital expenditures to distribution systems including primarily pipeline and service connection repair, refurbishment, or replacement may improve entity value and provide strong investment returns."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Energy Management,"Entities in the Water Utilities & Services industry consume significant amounts of energy for the withdrawal, conveyance, treatment, and distribution or discharge of potable water and wastewater. Typically, an entity’s largest operating cost afterpurchased water, chemicals, labour and utility operating costs is energy use. Purchased grid electricity is the most common energy input. In more remote locations, entities may use on-site generation to power equipment. The inefficientuse of purchased grid electricity creates environmental externalities, such as increased Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental regulations may affect the future grid energy mix, resulting in price increases. Additionally, climate change is expected to impact grid reliability and affect the availability of water resources. As a result, water utility energy intensity may increase in the future as water resource access becomes more difficult. Alternative water treatment, such as recyclingand desalination, also can require more energy. Together with decisions about the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy and on-site electricity generation, energy efficiency can influence both the cost and the reliability of the energy supply."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Effluent Quality Management,"Water and wastewater treatment facilities produce effluent that poses potential environmental and human health risks. Effluent includes residuals and solids that consist of chemicals used in the treatment process and contaminants removed from raw water or wastewater inputs. Treated effluent is discharged from facilities into surface water or pumped into groundwater. Potential environmental impacts vary depending on the treatment and disposal process. Additionally, consumers and regulators are becoming increasingly concerned by substances including endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which wastewater treatment facilities do not typically address. As a result of the environmental risks associated with effluent, treatment facilities are subject to extensive environmental regulations intended to control and monitor theirimpact. As public and regulatory scrutiny of effluent quality increases with new concerns about substances of emerging concern, entities will need to innovate and ensure that effluent is not harmful to the environment or human health. Effluent discharges exceeding maximum limits can result in significant regulatory penalties, and frequent episodes may jeopardise a utility’s social license to operate. Entities can actively manage financial impacts through infrastructure and equipment planning, maintenance, and operations, as well as the deployment of appropriately trained and experienced labour."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Water Affordability & Access,"Reliable access to clean water is commonly viewed as a basic human right. Reasonable and affordable pricing is a component of this right. Thus, structuring water rates in a way that the community perceives to be fair is critical to the value of water utility entities. Entities that are able to work with regulators to implement rate structures that increase levels of community acceptance are likely to create greater financial stability and potentially realise growth opportunities—especially in light of the underfunded nature of water infrastructure in many regions around the world. Water utilities that use rate mechanisms that inhibit access to water, or that are prohibitively expensive to low-income populations, may see community opposition. Entities must ensure fair pricing and access, as well as rates that can adequately fund infrastructure in the long term, provide safe drinking water and adequate wastewater treatment, and collect an adequatereturn on capital."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,End-Use Efficiency,"Consumer level water efficiency and conservation—whether a product of government mandates, environmental consciousness or demographic trends—is increasingly important for long-term resource availability and the financial performance of the water supply segment of the industry. How utilities work with regulators to mitigate revenue declines while increasing end-use resource efficiency may be financially material. Water efficiency mechanisms, including rate decoupling, may ensure that a utility’s revenue can adequately cover its fixed costs and provide the desired level of returnsregardless of sales volume, while incentivising customers to conserve water. Efficiency mechanisms can align utilities’ economic incentives with environmental and social interests, including improved resource efficiency, lower rates and increased capital investments in infrastructure. Water utilities may manage rate mechanism impacts through positive regulatory relations, forward-looking rate cases that incorporate efficiency and a strong execution of efficiency strategy."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Network Resiliency & Impacts of Climate Change,"Climate change may create uncertainty for water supply systems and wastewater systems because of potential impacts oninfrastructure and operations. Climate change may result in increased water stress, more frequent severe weather events, reduced water quality and rising sea levels that could impair utility assets and operations. Water supply and wastewater disposal are basic services for which maintaining operational continuity is of utmost importance. The increasing frequencyand severity of storms challenge water and wastewater treatment facilities, and these factors can affect service continuity.Intense precipitation may result in sewage volumes that exceed treatment facility capacity resulting in the release of untreated effluent. Minimising current and future risks of service disruptions and improving service quality may require additional capital expenditures and operational expenses. As the likelihood of extreme weather events increases, entities that address these risks through redundancies and strategic planning may better serve customers and improve performance."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Drinking Water Quality,"Entities in the industry must ensure that water conforms to regulations, is in line with customer expectations, and is reliably delivered. In order to protect human health and safeguard entity value, entities must protect water sources from contamination, which may reduce treatment processes and costs. Comprehensive treatment processes are designed, developed, and maintained to meet water quality standards, while the finished water output is routinely monitored for compliance and safety. Natural events, such as forest fires and flooding, can also impact the quality of water sources. Overall, entities invest significant resources to consistently deliver safe drinking water to customers. Failure to provide water of adequate quality may result in regulatory fines, litigation, increased operating costs or capital expenditures, reputational risk, and asset or business seizure."
Infrastructure,Water Utilities & Services,Water Supply Resilience,"Water supply systems obtain water from groundwater and surface water sources. Water supplies either may be accessed directly or purchased from a third party, often a government entity. Water scarcity, water source contamination, infrastructure failures, regulatory restrictions, competing users and overconsumption by customers are all factors that mayjeopardise sufficient water supply access. These issues, combined with an increasing risk of extreme and frequent droughtconditions because of climate change, may result in inadequate supplies or mandated water restrictions. The related financial impacts may manifest in diverse ways, depending on rate structure, but are most likely to impact entity value through decreased revenue. Water supply challenges also may increase the price of purchased water, which could result inhigher operating costs. Failures of critical infrastructure such as aqueducts and canals, which could result from events such as earthquakes, can present catastrophic risks to customers of the water supply system and could inflict untold financial consequences. Entities may mitigate water supply risks (and the resulting financial risks) through diversification of water supplies, sustainable withdrawal levels, technological and infrastructure improvements, contingency planning, positive relations with regulators and other major users, as well as rate structures."
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Product Safety,"Product safety is an important consideration for aerospace and defence entities given the industry’s key role in commercialaviation and military operations. Product safety incidents could result in financial impacts, including increased costs, regulatory penalties, or brand-value impacts that could adversely affect market share. Additionally, counterfeit components have been found in the aerospace and defence supply chain, increasing the risk of safety incidents due to low product quality. Through product design, supplier vetting, and ongoing customer engagement involving maintenanceand accident investigations, entities in this industry can ensure the safety of their products over the long term, mitigating potential financial consequences such as revenue loss due to repeated safety incidents or recalls."
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Hazardous Waste Management,"Aerospace and defence product manufacturing may generate hazardous process waste, including, but not limited to, heavy metals and wastewater treatment sludge. Entities face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste, assome wastes are subject to regulations pertaining to their transport, treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, where possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, can lower entities’ long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties."
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Materials Sourcing,"Aerospace and defence entities are exposed to supply chain risks when critical materials are used in products. Entities in the industry manufacture products using critical materials with few or no available substitutes, many of which are sourcedfrom deposits concentrated in only a few countries which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Entities in this industry also face competition due to increasing global demand for these materials from other sectors, which can result in price increases and supply risks. Entities that are able to limit the use of critical materials through use of alternatives, as well as secure their supply, can mitigate the potential for financial impacts stemming from supply disruptions and volatile input prices."
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Energy Management,"Energy is a critical input to aerospace and defence manufacturing processes. Purchased electricity is the largest share of the industry’s energy expenditures, followed by purchased fuels. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption andenergy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. An entity’s energy mix, including electricitygenerated on-site, grid-sourced electricity and alternative energy, may influence the cost and reliability of energy supply and, ultimately, affect the entity’s cost structure and regulatory risk."
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Fuel Economy & Emissions in Use-phase,"Customer preferences and regulatory incentives are increasing the demand for energy-efficient and reduced-emissions products in the Aerospace & Defence industry. Many of the industry’s products are powered by fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions during use. As the designers and manufacturers of most of the global aerospace and defence transportation fleet, entities in this industry have a unique opportunity to support many industries and government agencies that are striving to meet GHG emissions and fuel-management goals and imperatives. Productswith higher fuel economy and lower use-phase emissions may capture expanding market share and adapt to changing customer preferences and regulations around fuel economy and emissions more effectively."
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Business Ethics,"Aerospace and defence entities may be vulnerable to regulatory scrutiny of business ethics because of their operations in regions with weaker government enforcement of business ethics laws. Entities in this industry have been found in violation of corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act. Unethical practices may jeopardise future revenue growth due to reputational risks and can result in significant legal costs and a higher risk profile. As such, strong governance practices can mitigate the risk of violations of business ethics laws and resulting regulatory penalties or brand-value impacts.  "
Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Data Security,"Entities in the Aerospace & Defence industry may develop sensitive military and advanced aviation products, and entities in this industry may therefore be at a high risk for cyber attacks. A data security breach can be costly for an entity and its clients when information systems are compromised. Ensuring data security may require aerospace and defence entities to invest in research and development and increase capital expenditures in the short to medium term to improve the securityof their systems and their products. Significant or frequent disruptions or security breaches may result in regulatory action,legal action, or adversely impact revenues and brand value."
Financials,Consumer Finance,Selling Practices,"There are three key elements within the Selling Practices topic, performance of which can materially impact entity operations and financial condition. First, entity policies related to the structure of compensation and/or other incentives may unintentionally create the risk of selling products and services that are not in the best interest of clients. Secondly, a failure to provide transparent information to customers about primary and add-on products can increase the risk of being charged with using deceptive practices. And finally, depending on the characteristics of the portfolio of products sold, poor performance on the first two elements could result in a high concentration of risky products held by customers. Consumer finance entities are likely to continue to face increased scrutiny in the wake of high-profile incidents as regulators attempt to ensure transparency and enhanced disclosure. The disclosure of key characteristics of a lending portfolio, including average fees from add-on products, average age of accounts, average APR, average number of trade lines, and average annual fees for pre-paid transaction products will allow shareholders to determine which consumer finance entities are better positioned to protect long-term value rather than relying on short-term revenue generation practices. Ability to provide consumer finance products that are in the best interest of customers can help entities in the industry not only minimise risk exposure in the existent portfolio of products, but also build trust with new and existent customers, and expand their market share ensuring sustainable revenue growth. "
Financials,Consumer Finance,Customer Privacy,"Consumer finance entities face risks and opportunities associated with their internal use of data supplied by customers foractivities that are not the primary purpose for which the data were collected (for example, for use in targeted advertising and/or transfer to third parties). Ensuring the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) and other data of account holders is an essential responsibility of entities in the Consumer Finance industry. To assess performance on this issue, investors would benefit from disclosure from entities on the number of account holders whose information is used for secondary purposes, and their policies and procedures around using such information, including the nature of their opt-inpolicies. Combined with information on legal or regulatory actions taken against the entities that are related to customer protection and privacy, such disclosure would be decision-useful to investors. Consumer finance entities that fail to manage performance in this area are susceptible to decreased revenues as a result of lost consumer confidence and churn, as well as to financial impacts stemming from legal exposures. "
Financials,Consumer Finance,Data Security,"Entities in the Consumer Finance industry face risks and opportunities associated with how they manage the safety of data supplied to them by customers, in the context of external threats. Ensuring the security of customers’ PII is an essential responsibility of entities in the Consumer Finance industry. To assess performance on this issue, analysts would benefit from disclosure on efforts related to safeguarding data against emerging and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and technologies, actual security breaches compromising customers’ personally identifiable information (PII), and credit and debit card fraud. Entities that fail to manage performance in this area are susceptible to decreased revenues as a result of decreased consumer confidence and churn. Furthermore, instances of data breaches may expose entities to costly and lengthy litigations and potential monetary losses. "
Financials,Commercial Banks,Factors in Credit Analysis,"As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities through their lending practices. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the underlying entities, assets and projects to which commercial banks lend across a range of industries. Therefore, entities increasingly must examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral. Commercial banks also may enable positive environmental and social externalities to generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific sustainability trends. Specifically, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address climate change related risks."
Financials,Commercial Banks,Financed Emissions,"Entities participating in commercial banking activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissionsassociated with those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher emissions might be more susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change which in turn can impact the prospects of a financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise through related technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in commercial banking activities are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This measurement serves as an indicator of an entity’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how it might need to adapt its financial activities over time."
Financials,Commercial Banks,Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building,"Commercial banks, as their primary business activity, have to continuously balance their capacity building efforts with the risks and opportunities associated with lending to unbanked, underbanked, or underserved customers. Emerging financing models and technologies provide banks with an opportunity to offer products and services in previously underserved markets and obtain additional sources of revenue. Firms that are able to meet the need to extend credit and financial services to low-income populations and small businesses while avoiding predatory and irresponsible lending practices are likely to create long-term value and enhance social capital. These services should also be complemented by efforts to improve financial literacy, which will ensure that customers make informed decisions. The recent financial crisis demonstrated the importance of diversified and resilient funding sources that these communities can provide. By disclosing their approach to financial inclusion and capacity building, commercial banks can provide investors with decision-useful information for assessing banks' ability to ensure long-term, sustainable value creation. "
Financials,Commercial Banks,Business Ethics,"The regulatory environment surrounding the Commercial Banks industry continues to evolve in various jurisdictions globally. Commercial banks must adhere to a complex and inconsistent set of rules relating to performance and conduct as well as disclosure on issues including insider trading, anti-trust, price fixing, and market manipulation. In addition, commercial banks are subject to rules against tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and corrupt practices. Finally, in somejurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistleblowers may increase the number of complaints brought to regulators. Firms that are able to ensure regulatory compliance through robust internal controls will be better positioned to build trust withclients, leading to increased revenue, and to protect shareholder value by minimising losses incurred as a result of legal proceedings."
Financials,Commercial Banks,Systemic Risk Management,"The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the importance of managing risks to capital in the Commercial Banks industry. Specifically, firms that failed to manage the risk suffered significant losses to the value of their financial assets while increasing the amount of liabilities held on their books, which, due to the interconnectedness of the financial system, contributed to a significant market disruption. The systemic nature of the risk results from the interconnectedness of financial institutions and has become a central concern of national and international regulators. As a result, many banks are required to undergo supervisory stress tests to evaluate whether the entity has the capital to absorb losses, continue operations, and meet obligations in the event of adverse economic and financial conditions. Their failure to meet regulatory requirements could substantially raise future compliance cost as well as lead to monetary penalties. In an effortto demonstrate how the risks associated with banks’ size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability, and cross-jurisdictional activity are being managed, commercial banks should enhance disclosure on quantitative and qualitative metrics measuring how well they are positioned to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and meet stricter regulatory requirements."
Financials,Commercial Banks,Data Security,"Ensuring the privacy and data security of personal financial data is an essential responsibility of the Commercial Banks industry. Entities that fail to manage performance in this area are susceptible to decreased revenue and consumer confidence. As growth in mobile banking and cloud storage continues and more of banks’ operations become technology- and internet-dependent, data security will be an increasingly important issue to manage. Sophisticated technology and continuous training of personnel are essential in a world of growing cybersecurity threats. The metrics forthis disclosure topic focus on providing more detail on efforts related to safeguarding data against emerging and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and technologies, and actual security breaches compromising customers' personally identifiable information (PII). Enhanced disclosure on management strategies to address these risks will allow shareholders to understand how commercial banks are protecting shareholder value."
Food & Beverage,Alcoholic Beverages,Water Management,"Water management includes an entity’s direct water use, exposure to water scarcity and management of wastewater. Entities in the Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, since water is a key input for their finished products. Given alcoholic beverage entities’ heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and water scarcity is increasing in different regions globally, entities may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and increase costs. Entities operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may risk losing their social license to operate. Improving water management through increased efficiency and recycling, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can result in lower operating costs, reduced risks and higher intangible asset value."
Food & Beverage,Alcoholic Beverages,Packaging Lifecycle Management,"Packaging materials represent a significant cost to entities in the Alcoholic Beverages industry. Although many alcoholic beverage entities do not manufacture their own bottles and packaging, they face reputational risks associated with the negative externalities that their products’ containers can create over their lifecycle. Entities are also directly impacted by legislation regarding end-of-life management of beverage containers. Alcoholic beverage entities can work with packaging manufacturers on packaging design to generate cost savings, improve brand reputation, and reduce the environmental impact. Efforts to reduce the amount of materials used in packaging can reduce transportation costs, exposure to supply and price volatility, and the amount of virgin materials extracted. In the end-of-life phase, take-back and recycling programs and partnerships can pre-empt regulation, help achieve cost savings, and reduce environmental impact. Entities that effectively manage this issue can improve profitability and reduce cost of capital."
Food & Beverage,Alcoholic Beverages,Energy Management,"Entities in the Alcoholic Beverages industry rely on both fuel and purchased electricity as critical inputs. Fossil fuel and electrical energy consumption can contribute to negative environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These impacts have the potential to affect the value of entities in this industry since greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy could result in increased fossil fuels and conventional electricity price volatility, while making alternative sources more cost-competitive. Entities that manage for increased energy efficiency and use alternative energy sources may increase profitability by reducing both expenses and risks."
Food & Beverage,Alcoholic Beverages,Responsible Drinking & Marketing,"The irresponsible consumption of alcoholic beverages can lead to negative social externalities such as drunk driving, addiction, public health issues, underage drinking, and even death. Every year, irresponsible alcohol consumption contributes to millions of deaths worldwide, a large portion of which includes underage youth and young adults. The harmful use of alcohol is a growing concern, particularly in developing countries that do not have laws to protect against alcohol’s detrimental effects. Alcoholic beverage entities may be forced to internalise the costs of these social externalitiesthrough taxes, lawsuits, or reputational harm, which can have a material impact on operations and financial results. Failing to properly manage social externalities may lead to further unfavourable regulation and erode the industry’s social license to operate. Through education, engagement, community partnerships, and responsible marketing, particularly to underage individuals, entities can address and mitigate many of the social externalities associated with alcohol misuse. Entities that effectively manage this issue can reduce the likelihood of extraordinary expenses, improve market share, and decrease liabilities."
Food & Beverage,Alcoholic Beverages,Ingredient Sourcing,"Entities in the Alcoholic Beverages industry source a wide range of ingredients, largely agricultural inputs, from suppliers worldwide. The industry’s ability to source ingredients fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climatechange, water scarcity, land management and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can result in price volatility and can affect entity profitability. Ultimately, climate change, water scarcity and land-use restriction present risks to an entity’s long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Entities that source ingredients that are more productive, effectively cultivated and less resource-intensive, or those that work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and manage exposure to other resource scarcity risks may reduce price volatility or supply disruptions."
Food & Beverage,Alcoholic Beverages,Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain,"Entities in the Alcoholic Beverages industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. Howentities screen, monitor and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects entities’ ability to secure supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain interruption can cause loss of revenue and negatively impact market share if entities are unable to find alternatives for key suppliers or must source ingredients at a higher cost. Supply chain management issues related to labour practices, environmental responsibility, ethics or corruption may also result in regulatory fines or increased long-term operational costs. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier actions. Managing an entity’s exposure to environmental and social risks may improve supply chain resiliency and enhance an entity’s reputation. Entities can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities."
Technology & Communications,Internet Media & Services,Intellectual Property Protection & Competitive Behaviour,"Despite the openness of the Internet, entities in the Internet Media & Services industry spend a significant proportion of their revenues on intellectual property (IP) protection, including acquiring patents and copyrights. While IP protection is inherent to the business model of some entities in the industry and is an important driver of innovation, the IP practices ofentities can be a contentious societal issue. Entities could sometimes acquire patents and other IP protection to restrict competition and access to benefits from innovation, particularly if they are dominant market players. Due to the complexity of software, its abstract nature, and increasing IP rights protection related to software, Internet Media & Services entities have to navigate overlapping patent claims to be able to operate. As a result, entities in the industry may find themselves constantly in litigation or subject to regulatory scrutiny either due to allegations of patent violations if they engage in unethical business practices, or are perceived as doing so, or because they are suing others for IP infringement. Adverse legal or regulatory rulings related to antitrust and IP can expose internet media and services entitiesto costly and lengthy litigations and potential monetary losses as a result. Such rulings may also affect an entity’s market share and pricing power if its patents or dominant position in key markets are legally challenged, with significant impact on revenue. Therefore, entities that can balance the protection of their IP and its use to spur innovation with ensuring their IP management and other business practices do not unfairly restrict competition, have the potential to lower regulatory scrutiny and legal actions while protecting their market value."
Technology & Communications,Internet Media & Services,Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure,"With the Internet & Media Services industry providing a growing amount of content and service offerings, entities in this industry increasingly own, operate or rent more data centres and other hardware. Thus, managing the energy and water use associated with IT hardware infrastructure is relevant to value creation. Data centres must be powered continuously. Energy supply disruptions may have a material impact on operations depending on the disruption magnitude and timing. Entities face a trade-off between energy and water consumption because of data centre cooling needs. Cooling data centres with water instead of chillers improves energy efficiency, but this method may create dependence on significant local water resources. Data centre specification decisions are important for managing costs, obtaining a reliable energy and water supply, and reducing reputational risks, particularly with the increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and the opportunities arising from energy efficiency and renewable energy innovations."
Technology & Communications,Internet Media & Services,"Data Privacy, Advertising Standards & Freedom of Expression","Entities in the Internet & Media Services industry rely on customer data to innovate new tools and services, generate revenues through advertising sales, and track and prevent criminal activities, such as hacking and online predators targeting children. However, the use and storage of a wide range of customer data, such as personal, demographic, content, and behavioural data, raises privacy concerns, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny in many countries around the world. Entities face reputational risks from providing access to user data to governments, which raises concerns that the data may be used to limit the freedoms of citizens. This issue has impacts on entity profitability through the loss of users and can influence decisions to enter or operate in certain markets."
Technology & Communications,Internet Media & Services,"Employee Recruitment, Inclusion & Performance","Employees are key contributors to value creation in the Internet Media & Services industry. While the number of job openings in the industry continues to grow, entities are finding it difficult to recruit qualified employees to fill these positions. The shortage in technically skilled domestic employees has created intense competition to acquire highly skilled employees, contributing to high employee turnover rates. In response to talent shortages, entities are hiring foreign nationals, which creates risks related to perceived social implications in the host and home countries of workers. Entities offer significant monetary and non-monetary benefits in order to improve employee engagement and, therefore, retention and productivity increase. Initiatives to improve employee engagement and work-life balance might influence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce. As the industry is characterised by relatively low representation fromwomen and minority groups, efforts to recruit from and develop diverse talent pools can serve to address the talent shortage and generally to improve the value of entity offerings. Greater workforce diversity is important for innovation, and it helps entities understand the needs of their diverse and global customer base."
Technology & Communications,Internet Media & Services,Data Security,"Entities in the Internet Media & Services industry are subject to a large and growing number of cyber attacks and social engineering threats, which puts customer information and an entity's own data at risk. Inadequate prevention, detection, and remediation of data security threats can influence customer acquisition and retention and result in decreased market share and lower demand for the entity’s products and/or services. By identifying and addressing data security threats in a timely manner entities can protect brand value and will be better positioned for customer acquisition and retention. Furthermore, effective management can avoid significant expenses associated with data breaches—most commonly directed at recapturing users following a breach."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment,"The Oil & Gas – Services industry is subject to numerous sustainability-related regulations and an often rapidly changing regulatory environment. Changes to the legal and regulatory environment may result in material impacts on shareholder value. Entities in the industry regularly participate in the regulatory and legislative process on a wide variety of environmental and societal issues, and may do so directly or through representation by an industry association. Such engagement can result from entities seeking to ensure industry views are represented in the development of regulations impacting the industry as well as to represent shareholder interests. At the same time, such engagement to influence environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect entities’ reputations with stakeholders and ultimately impact the entity’s social license to operate. Entities that are able to balance these viewpoints may be better positioned to respond tomedium- to long-term regulatory developments."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Business Ethics & Payments Transparency,"With operations across the globe, oil and gas services entities interact with many government and local officials, either directly or through agents, in order to secure contracts with state-owned oil entities and multinational corporations. Bribery and corruption are common in some regions, and in others, to the transparency of payments to governments maybe a significant issue. The emergence of several anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and payments-transparency laws and initiatives create regulatory mechanisms to reduce certain risks. Violations of these could lead to significant one-time costsor higher ongoing compliance costs, whereas successful compliance with such regulations could provide risk mitigation opportunities and avoid adverse outcomes. Oil and gas services entities are under pressure to ensure that their governance structures and practices can address corruption, willful or unintentional participation in illegal or unethical payments and gifts to government officials or private persons, or the risk of otherwise unfairly influencing these individuals, especially in areas of heightened risk."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Water Management Services,"Oil and gas development often requires large quantities of water, exposing producers to the risks of water scarcity, water use regulations and related cost increases, particularly in water-stressed regions. Producers also must manage wastewater disposal risks and costs. As such, service entities that develop superior technologies and processes, such as closed-loop water recycling systems to reduce customers’ water consumption and disposal costs, may gain market share and increase revenue, because drilling and wastewater management can be a significant competitive factor for their customers."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Ecological Impact Management,"Oil and gas exploration and development activities, and associated services and support activities, can have significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly when entities operate in ecologically sensitive areas or are characterised by highly resource-intensive operations. These can occur through disposal of drilling and associated wastes, well decommissioning, land use, and fuel spills. Producers face regulatory risks from legislation and permitting to protect ecosystems in the U.S. and abroad, and from regulations specifically related to well decommissioning or underground waste injection. Oil and gas services entities that are able to offer cost-effective and efficient production and decommissioning technologies that mitigate impacts on biodiversity by reducing land use, drilling wastes, and spills can lower associated risks for their customers and gain a competitive advantage."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Workforce Health & Safety,"Workers in the Oil & Gas – Services industry face significant health and safety risks due to the harsh working environments and hazards of handling oil and gas. In addition to acute impacts resulting from accidents, workers may develop chronic health conditions, including those caused by silica or dust inhalation, as well as mental health problems. A significant proportion of the workforce at oil and gas drilling sites consists of temporary workers and employees of oil and gas services entities. Health impacts on, and the safety performance of, such workers can affect Services entities directly by influencing worker productivity and costs. Services entities compete on the basis of their reputation and ability to perform activities on a consistently safe basis. Customers evaluate instances of accidents, spills, injuries, and fatalities when considering awarding contracts to services entities. "
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Critical Incident Risk Management,"Services entities are subject to significant risks associated with low-probability, high-consequence events associated with oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities. Such events may result in multiple fatalities, significant property damage, or a significant adverse impact to the environment. Services entities may be affected indirectly through the impacts that safety incidents or emergencies can have on their Exploration & Production (E&P) customers. Additionally, significant incidents can have wide-ranging negative social and environmental consequences, for which bothE&P and service entities may be held liable. Services entities compete on the basis of their reputation and ability to perform activities on a consistently safe basis. In addition to implementing effective process safety management practices,entities frequently prioritise developing a strong culture of safety in order to reduce the probability that accidents and other health and safety incidents will occur. If accidents and other emergencies do occur, entities with a strong safety culture are often able to more effectively detect and respond to such incidents. A culture that engages and empowers employees and contractors to work with management and E&P entities in order to safeguard their own health, safety, and well-being and to prevent accidents is likely to help services entities reduce risks to financial value."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Chemicals Management,"Oil and Gas - Services entities produce oilfield chemicals as well as drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids based on demand from Exploration & Production (E&P) entities. While the risk of leaks from a properly drilled and completed well islow, contamination of local water resources can result from contact with hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water, and may arise from issues related to well integrity. Concerns about certain chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids have led to fracturing bans, regulation, and legislative proposals to mandate disclosure of chemicals used in some regions,both in the U.S. and abroad. The exact chemical composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids is often proprietary information, and entities compete to create the most effective formulas. In the U.S., some entities are voluntarily disclosing information about the hydraulic fracturing chemicals they use through an industry registry, FracFocus. Due to public and regulatory attention to the potential hazards of drilling fluids, entities that are able to manage issues related towell development and integrity, the production and use of produce effective non-hazardous fracking fluids, and the reduction of the volumes of drilling fluids used per well, may increase their market share and revenues and lower the risk that regulations affect demand for their products."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Emissions Reduction Services & Fuels Management,"Although direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and associated regulatory risks are relatively low for oil and gas services providers relative to other industries, emissions from the operations of their customers—the oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) entities—can be significant. Emissions include GHGs that can contribute to climate change as well as other air pollutants that can have significant localised human health and environmental impacts. Increasing regulation and high costs of fuels associated with these emissions present substantial risk to E&P entities. Entities are seeking ways to lower their emissions, including converting pumps and engines to run on natural gas and electricity instead of diesel fuel. Oil and gas services entities compete for contracts partly based on providing innovative, efficient technologies that can help E&P entities reduce operating costs and improve process efficiencies. Services entities can gain a competitive advantage, grow revenue and secure market share by providing customers with services and equipment to reduce GHG, fugitive and flared emissions and fuel consumption."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Water Management,"Processed Foods entities rely on a reliable water supply for cooking, processing and cleaning finished goods. Additionally, entities in the industry generate and must manage the wastewater discharge from processing activities. As water scarcity becomes an issue of increasing importance, processed foods entities—operating in water-stressed regions—may face increasing operational risks. Entities in the industry may face higher operational costs as well as water shortages because of the physical availability or more stringent regulations. Entities can manage water-related risks and opportunities through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and partnerships with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Food Safety,"Food safety, as it relates to production quality, spoilage, contamination, supply chain traceability, and allergy labelling, canmaterially affect processed foods entities. Food safety recalls can happen for numerous reasons, including packaging defects, food contamination, spoilage, and mislabeling. Food safety issues that arise within an entity’s supply chain typically result in recalls of final products and can also influence the brand reputation, operations, and revenue of processed foods entities. Supply chain traceability is a great concern for entities in the industry, particularly amid new regulations. Poor management of food quality and safety may lead to damage to brand value, lower revenues, and increased costs associated with recalls, fines, lost inventory, and/or litigation. Obtaining food safety certifications or ensuring suppliers meet food safety guidelines may help entities in the industry safeguard product safety and communicate the quality of their products to retailers and consumers."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Product Labelling & Marketing,"Communication with consumers through product labelling and marketing is an important facet of processed foods entities. The accuracy and depth of information presented in food labelling is of importance to regulators and consumers.Labelling regulations require specific and detailed product information to ensure food safety and inform consumers of nutritional content. Additionally, to help inform purchasing decisions, consumers are increasingly interested in further information about the ingredients used in processed foods, such as genetically modified organism (GMO) content, and about the production methods used. Another area of public concern is the marketing practices of processed foods entities, especially those targeted to children or on nutritional claims, and whether they present potentially untruthful or misleading information. Product labelling and marketing issues can affect the competitive landscape of the industry, as entities may be subject to litigation or criticism resulting from misleading statements or failing to adapt to consumer demand for increased labelling transparency. Additionally, regulations on product labelling and marketing introduce near-term costs to adhere and present the risk of penalties or litigation. All of these factors can impact an entity’s brand value, operating costs, and revenue growth."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Packaging Lifecycle Management,"Packaging materials represent a major business cost and contribute to the environmental footprint of processed foods entities. Each stage of a package’s lifecycle, including design, transportation, and disposal, presents its own unique environmental challenges and opportunities. Entities may be impacted by regulations on allowable packaging materials orend-of-life management of packaging. Processed foods entities can work with packaging manufacturers on packaging design to generate cost savings, improve brand reputation, and reduce their environmental impact. Innovations such as light-weighting materials can also result in cost benefits in the transportation of goods. Other innovations can improve end-of-life management of products, such as through the use of recyclable or compostable materials, which may mitigatepotential risks related to costs and compliance. "
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Energy Management,"The Processed Foods industry is reliant on energy and fuel as primary inputs for value creation in manufacturing food products. Energy is needed to operate large manufacturing facilities for cooking, refrigeration and packaging. Energy production and consumption contributes to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential indirectly, yet materially, to affect processed food entity operations. Energy efficiency in production and distribution can mitigate exposure to volatile energy costs and limit an entity’s contribution to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Producers may be able to reduce the risk posed by volatile fossil fuel energy costs—particularly natural gas, which the industry uses heavily—by diversifying their energy portfolio across a range of sources. Decisions regarding alternative fuels use, renewable energy and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid, may influence both the costs and reliability of the energy supply."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Ingredient Sourcing,"Entities in the Processed Foods industry source a wide range of ingredients, largely agricultural inputs, from global suppliers. The industry’s ability to source ingredients, and at some price points, fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure may cause price volatility which may affect entity profitability. Climate change, water scarcity and land-use restrictions present risks to an entity’s long-term ability to source essential materials and ingredients. Entities that source ingredients which are more productive and less resource-intensive, or coordinate with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, may reduce price volatility and supply disruptions."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain,"Entities in the Processed Foods industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How entities screen, monitor and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects the ability of entities to maintain steady supplies and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain management issues related to labour and environmental practices, ethics or corruption also may result in regulatory fines or increased long-term operational costs for entities. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier performance. Entities can engage with important suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, potentially increase consumer demand, or capture new market opportunities."
Food & Beverage,Processed Foods,Health & Nutrition,"Key nutritional and health concerns such as obesity, ingredient safety, and nutritional value are shaping the Processed Foods industry’s competitive landscape. The health and nutrition characteristics of the industry’s products and ingredients are of growing concern to both consumers and regulators, thus creating the potential for these issues to affect a processed food entity’s reputation and its license to operate. New regulations, including imposed taxes on processed foods, may impact industry profitability and pose long-term risks in the form of reduced demand for the industry’s products. Entities that adapt to changing consumer preferences to promote more healthful and nutritious offerings may be better positioned to gain market share in a growing segment while avoiding the risks associated with potential regulation and shifts in demand."
Resource Transformation,Industrial Machinery & Goods,Remanufacturing Design & Services,"Industrial machinery and goods manufacturing uses large quantities of steel, iron, aluminium, glass, plastics, and other materials. Remanufacturing of industrial machinery systems (called ""cores"") is an opportunity for industrial machinery entities to limit the amount of raw materials needed to produce new machinery, as well as the time and other resources required to produce finished goods. Remanufactured products can also create value from products otherwise destined fordisposal or recycling. Industrial machinery entities can achieve cost savings by reusing end-of-life parts to build remanufactured machines, which may be resold to customers. Thus, remanufacturing in process and design can reduce demand for raw materials, reduce manufacturing costs, and create new sales channels."
Resource Transformation,Industrial Machinery & Goods,Materials Sourcing,"Industrial machinery entities are exposed to supply chain risks when critical materials are used in products. Entities in the industry manufacture products using critical materials with few or no available substitutes, many of which are sourced from deposits concentrated in only a few countries, which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Entities in this industry also face competition due to increasing global demand for these materials from other sectors, which can result in price increases and supply risks. Entities that are able to limit the use of critical materials through use of alternatives, as well as secure their supply, can mitigate the potential for financial impacts stemming from supply disruptions and volatile input prices."
Resource Transformation,Industrial Machinery & Goods,Energy Management,"Energy is a critical input in industrial machinery manufacturing. Purchased electricity is the largest share of energy expenditure in the industry, followed by purchased fuels. The type of energy used, amount consumed and energy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. Including the use of electricity generated on site, grid-sourced electricity and alternative energy, an entity’s energy mix can influence the cost and reliability of energy supplyand, ultimately, affect the entity’s cost structure and regulatory risk."
Resource Transformation,Industrial Machinery & Goods,Fuel Economy & Emissions in Use-phase,"Many of the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry’s products are powered by fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions during use. Customer preferences for improved fuel economy combined with regulations restricting emissions are increasing the demand for energy-efficient and lower-emission products in the industry. As such, entities that develop products with these characteristics may capture expanding market share, reduce regulatory risk and improve brand value."
Resource Transformation,Industrial Machinery & Goods,Employee Health & Safety,"Employees in industrial machinery manufacturing facilities face health and safety risks from exposure to heavy machinery, moving equipment, and electrical hazards, among others. Creating an effective safety culture is critical to proactively mitigate safety incidents, which could result in higher healthcare costs, litigation, and work disruption. By implementing strong safety protocols, including incident reporting and investigation, and promoting a culture of safety, entities can minimise safety-related expenses and potentially improve productivity in the long term. "
Financials,Security & Commodity Exchanges,Managing Conflicts of Interest,"Security and commodity exchanges are responsible for the oversight of member entities. Specifically, firms in this industry monitor membership information and regulatory compliance to ensure market integrity and transparency. For example, in the U.S., they investigate and prosecute member entities that violate the Securities and Exchange Act. Recent controversies relating to market manipulation, tax fraud, investor protection rules, and anti-trust have raised concern about conflicts of interest that arise due to security and commodity exchanges’ position as self-regulatory organisations (SROs). Rapid innovation in financial markets provides significant opportunities to enhance profitability. However, exchanges must continue to fulfil their responsibilities as SROs to ensure open and fair access to all investors, to publish rules and fees, and to oversee trading. Entities that avoid fraudulent or unethical activities will maintain market integrity, limit reputational damage, and ensure their long-term sustainable growth."
Financials,Security & Commodity Exchanges,Promoting Transparent & Efficient Capital Markets,"Security and commodity exchanges have a responsibility to ensure equal access to capital markets for all investors. As public markets, these entities play a critical role in efficient capital allocation and the equal application of rules to all participants. In addition, entities must manage the release of public information to prevent asymmetries. Further, with theadvent of high-frequency trading there is heightened concern that technology can lead to advantages for certain traders at the expense of others. Information asymmetries that lead to unfair arbitrage could result in litigations and, potentially, regulatory penalties, additional regulatory oversight and compliance costs, as well as reputational damage that may hurt trading volumes and thus revenues. Disclosure of policies relating to information releases, halts of trading, and the risks and opportunities associated with algorithmic or high-frequency trading will allow investors to further understand how security and commodity exchanges protect shareholder value."
Financials,Security & Commodity Exchanges,Managing Business Continuity & Technology Risks,"Security and commodity exchanges face increased risks and opportunities associated with information technology. The industry’s central position in the proper functioning of financial markets requires that issues including security breaches and technology errors are managed to prevent market disruptions. As security and commodity exchanges face increased volumes of trading associated with the clearing and execution of derivative trades and increased frequency of cyber attacks, the industry will be exposed to new risks and opportunities associated with its reliance on information technology. Failure to ensure continuity of trading may erode customer trust and result in lower trading volumes, thus lossof revenue. Increased disclosure of efforts taken to prevent these risks, in addition to the current performance, will allow shareholders to accurately assess value. "
Infrastructure,Real Estate Services,Sustainability Services,"In the Real Estate Services industry, buildings owned or occupied by clients generally have significant sustainability impacts. Buildings, and the activities that take place within them, drive energy consumption, direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, waste generation and indoor environmental quality concerns that can impact occupant health. Entities have an opportunity to improve the sustainability impacts of buildings and their operations through sustainability- related services. These services may include utility data management, energy procurement, energy and water benchmarking, resource efficiency improvements, activities related to sustainability certifications, and sustainability consulting and training. Entities may impact building sustainability further by arranging leases that incentivise both owners and tenants to improve sustainability performance, while yielding financial benefits forboth parties. Providing these services may drive new revenue growth and increase client retention. Effective sustainability services may benefit owners or tenants through improved asset values, increased tenant demand, decreased operating costs and improved tenant experiences."
Infrastructure,Real Estate Services,Interest,"The business model of real estate services entities is dependent on client trust and loyalty. To ensure long-term, mutually beneficial relationships, entities need to provide services that satisfy the highest professional and ethical standards of the industry. Professional integrity is an important governance issue, as the range of services and the number of professionals within a single organisation can make the management of conflicts of interest more challenging. Brokerage and appraisalservices may come with particularly high risk of conflicts of interest and negligence. In order to manage and avoid these risks, entities in the industry can implement a range of governance measures, including employee training, oversight, and policies, procedures, and enforcement systems focused on transparency and appropriate disclosures. Effective management of these risks can lead to increased client trust and better brand value in the market, adding to long-term revenue growth. Inadequate management of risks may lead to regulatory fines and penalties, as well as decreased client trust and a loss in business."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Customer Health & Safety,"Cruise lines offer a variety of luxury experiences and activities to their customers, including elaborate shows, casinos, fine dining, indoor skydiving, spa treatments, swimming, and fitness facilities. Each activity comes with its own set of health risks and safety challenges and liabilities that cruise entities must navigate. Consumer expectations for safety and comfortare high, so issues such as health risks and physical safety risks are especially important to avoid. Highly publicised cases of crimes, injuries, and illnesses onboard cruise ships can have serious impacts on brand value and ticket sales. There may also be high costs associated with customer lawsuits. While crime rates are low when compared to crime statistics in mostdeveloped countries, law enforcement is much trickier, and cases are not as easy to resolve as it is common for ships to take passengers to international waters and to fly a foreign flag, creating uncertainty about which jurisdictions are responsible for law enforcement needs. Entities can protect customer health and safety through implementation of a robust safety management system."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Cruise lines generate emissions mainly from the combustion of diesel in ship engines. The industry’s reliance on heavy fueloil (‘bunker fuel’) is of material concern because of rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. Evolving environmental regulations are encouraging the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines, engine retrofits and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency. In addition, GHG regulation violations may result in fines and compliance costs."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Air Quality,"Fuel use by cruise lines generates air pollutants such as sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM10). These pollutants tend to have localised environmental and health impacts and are especially a concern at port cities and other restricted areas where entities may be penalised for exceeding emissions limits. Entities are managing these risks by commissioning more energy-efficient vessels, retrofitting existing fleets, and using onshore power when it isavailable at ports."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Accident Management,"Although cruising is statistically one of the safest forms of travel for vacationing, the industry competes largely on customer experience and satisfaction, making safety management a top priority. Given the scale of cruise vessels and the vulnerability of passengers at sea, it may only take one mismanaged accident to shake consumer confidence in an entity. While major accidents are rare, they have the potential to affect not only an entity’s revenue and reputation, but those of the Cruise Lines industry as a whole. Proper equipment maintenance, staff training, and use of the latest safety technologies and practices across the entire fleet can protect an entity’s safety record and ensure high customer satisfaction while lowering an entity’s risk profile and cost of capital."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Discharge Management & Ecological Impacts,"Cruise vacations offer unique access to pristine ocean waters and destinations with delicate ecosystems. These sensitive ecosystems can be threatened by the size of the ships, the influx of tourists, and the scale of the resources consumed andwaste generated on board. Cruise ships discharge many types of treated and untreated wastewater at sea and non-degradable solid wastes on land. Careful management of ship discharge and mitigation of the ecological impacts of cruise line operations will ensure continued access to key ports and will help preserve the natural beauty that guests wish to experience, both of which are key for entities to maintain market share as well as attract new customers."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Employee Health & Safety,"Cruise entities operate a uniquely transitory service that requires them to provide all the safety oversight of a small city, including addressing all medical and security needs. A commitment to providing a clean and sanitary environment on board is important for protecting crew health, which can affect customer health and thus an entity’s reputation and market share. Additionally, there can be several governing bodies—including the flag state, port state, and home country of a crew member—involved in both providing and enforcing safety regulations for the industry. These regulations can create confusion regarding the protections afforded to crew members. Entities that fail to protect crew health and safety may also face higher turnover and difficulties in employee recruitment and retention."
Transportation,Cruise Lines,Labour Practices,"Cruise lines employ thousands of workers onboard each large vessel. Most ships are registered in countries where labour laws allow flexibility in many dimensions including pay, hours, fair treatment, and termination. Ship crews are multinational, and many are hired on a contract basis. Workers often put in long hours for months at a stretch and stay inshared quarters, which can make it difficult to recuperate. Some entities offer a gratuity-based wage structure to reduce payroll costs. Language barriers and the complexity of flag-state laws and the laws in workers’ home countries can make it difficult for workers to file charges in the case of labour law violations. Low morale among workers can impact their ability to meet customer service expectations, reducing an entity’s revenues and market share."
Consumer Goods,Household & Personal Products,"Product Environmental, Health, and Safety Performance","The Household & Personal Products industry faces growing consumer and regulatory pressure over the use of chemicals ofconcern, which have been linked to negative environmental externalities and impacts on human health. Some of these chemicals include persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substances and carcinogenic, mutagen, or teratogenic chemicals, all of which are under increased regulatory scrutiny. Isolating and determining causal channels for negative health and environmental impacts is difficult, which means there is often a significant lag between a product’s introduction to the market and the point at which regulation and/or public opinion causes entities in the industry to reformulate. Directives in the EU and legislation in the U.S. place restrictions on or suggest alternatives to the use of harmful chemicals within the industry. Separately, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. may secure greater regulatory power over chemicals used by the cosmetics industry, which would very likely result in higher costs for the Household & Personal Products industry. Large retailers have implemented programs to ban chemicals of concern in the products they sell, which is placing greater pressure on the industry. Entities that are able to anticipate the changing regulatory landscape and implement stricter processes and testing are more likely to gain a competitive advantage. Early adopters of innovations in green chemistry and the reduction of chemicals of concern may improve profitability by being better able to capture changing customer demand and avoiding regulatory burdens."
Consumer Goods,Household & Personal Products,Water Management,"Water is vital to the Household & Personal Products industry, both as a coolant in manufacturing processes and as a main input for many of the industry’s products. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the world because of population growth and increasing consumption, rapid urbanisation, and declining supplies because of subsurface aquifer depletion, drought and climate change. Many entities in this industry have operations in regions of the world facing water scarcity. Without careful planning, entities could face increased costs or lose water access in these regions, which may be a risk to production. Having rigorous checks in place to ensure a steady supply of water to all factories, as well as investing in technology to increase water use efficiency, will help entities reduce water-related risks as water scarcity becomes an increasingly global issue."
Consumer Goods,Household & Personal Products,Packaging Lifecycle Management,"The Household & Personal Products industry uses a large amount of materials for product packaging, which often constitutes a significant portion of entities’ expenses. In addition, packaging design, particularly packaging weight, has a direct impact on transportation expenses, which can be significant. At the same time, the industry is facing pressure from both consumers and large retail outlets to address the environmental characteristics of its packaging, as material extraction and waste contribute to environmental externalities. The sustainability performance of packaging depends largely on the type, use, and ultimate disposal of materials. However, entities that effectively manage the sustainability characteristics of their product packaging—including light-weighting of materials, the use of recycled content and recyclable materials, and the use of sustainably sourced materials—may be better positioned to capture shifting consumerdemand and avoid (or mitigate the impacts of) regulation related to extended producer responsibility. By managing the sustainability of product packaging, entities can also potentially reduce input and transportation costs."
Consumer Goods,Household & Personal Products,Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain,"Palm oil has increased in popularity as a cheap input for a wide range of goods in the Household & Personal Products industry, including cleaning products, candles and cosmetics. Palm oil harvesting in specific regions of the world may contribute to deforestation, GHG emissions and other environmental and social problems. If not sourced responsibly, palmoil materials contribute to environmental and social externalities that can present reputational and regulatory risks for entities. Furthermore, entities in this industry are exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions, input price increases and reputational damage associated with environmental and social externalities from palm oil sourcing. Entities face pressure to track and responsibly source palm oil and ensure minimum working condition standards in the supply chain, because palm oil production often is associated with labour issues. Implementing sourcing standards can reduce these risks, as canproduct-design phase innovations to reduce dependence on controversial materials such as palm oil."
Transportation,Air Freight & Logistics,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Air Freight & Logistics industry entities generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. Emissions are generated from fuel combustion by both air and road freight operations. Given the altitude of the emissions from jet fuel, air freight makes an especially potent contribution to climate change. Management of GHG emissions is likely to affect air freight and logistics entities’ cost structure over time because emissions are tied directly to fuel use, and thus to operating expenses. Fuel efficiency and alternative fuels usage may reduce fuel costs or limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, future regulatory costs and other consequences of GHG emissions. While newer aircraft and trucks are generally more fuel efficient, existing fleets may be retrofitted. Capital investments in more fuel-efficient aeroplanes or vehicles and emerging fuel-management technology may reduce fuel expenses and improve profitability. These investments also may help entities capture market share of customers seeking low-carbon shipping solutions."
Transportation,Air Freight & Logistics,Supply Chain Management,"Many entities in the Air Freight & Logistics industry contract with large, complex networks of asset-based third-party providers to provide freight transportation services to their customers. Contracting is common among entities providing freight forwarding, logistics, brokerage and intermodal services. Contractors range across all modes of transport such as motor carriers, railroads, air freight and ocean carriers. Entities must manage contractor relationships to ensure contractoractions that may have environmental or social impacts do not result in material adverse effects on their own operations, such as decreased brand value. At the same time, entities that offer low-carbon logistics solutions may capture market share from customers seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of their shipment."
Transportation,Air Freight & Logistics,Air Quality,"Entities in the Air Freight & Logistics industry generate air pollutants that may threaten human health. The industry’s primary air emissions include sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), which have localised negative effects on air quality. As regulators debate the most efficient mechanisms to reduce local air pollution from the industry, entities may be forced to increase operating costs or make investments to modernise their fleets due toregulatory pressure, customer demand, and rising fuel costs. Use of more expensive alternative fuels and mechanisms thatfilter emissions prior to release into atmosphere can also impact an entity’s cost structure, requiring upfront costs but decreasing exposure to regulation over the long term."
Transportation,Air Freight & Logistics,Employee Health & Safety,"Employees in the Air Freight & Logistics industry may be exposed to dangerous working conditions, including accidents resulting from mechanical failure or human error. Additionally, moving packages manually is a physical process that requires special training in order to minimise injury. While the fatal occupational injury rate for trucking workers is higher than average, worker safety issues in aviation are highly regulated, which raises the risk of fines or penalties when an incident occurs. Health and safety incidents may result in work stoppages and a range of costs, from medical expenses to workers compensation. Such incidents can also reduce productivity, and thus revenues, if employees believe their safety and well-being are not being prioritised. Finally, entities with poor safety records may also face increased insurance premiums and higher costs of capital, as well as reputational damage that could reduce revenue and market share. An entity can mitigate these impacts by providing adequate protection and training for employees, ensuring mechanical equipment is safely functioning, and establishing a culture of safety within the workplace."
Transportation,Air Freight & Logistics,Labour Practices,"The Air Freight & Logistic industry’s reliance on independent contractors, mainly for courier driving, has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. Independent contractors may not be not covered under the same laws that protect employees, and entities may face regulatory sanctions for misclassifying employees as independent contractors. Entities may also face legal actions from employee and contractor claims regarding wage payments, benefits, and working conditions. This may also negatively affect their reputation and ability to hire and retain employees, reducing operational efficiency and increasing turnover costs."
Transportation,Air Freight & Logistics,Accident & Safety Management,"All modes of transportation pose safety risks. In some cases, mechanical failure or human error may lead to accidents withsignificant environmental or social consequences, including regulatory action and lawsuits from impacted communities or customers. While the stringency of regulatory requirements may vary by the region of operation, entities that maintain the highest safety standards throughout their global operations can minimise the risks of safety incidents that affect their reputation and profitability."
Technology & Communications,Telecommunication Services,Competitive Behaviour & Open Internet,"The Telecommunication Services industry contains classic examples of natural monopolies, where high capital costs can allow them to offer the most efficient production. Given the concentrated nature of telecommunications, cable, and satellite entities, they must manage their growth strategies within the parameters of a regulatory landscape designed to ensure competition. In addition to natural monopoly, many entities in this industry benefit from terminal access monopolies over the so-called “last-mile” of their networks, given their contractual relationship with each subscriber and the barriers for subscribers to change service providers. The nature of this relationship is the basis of much of the discussion around the need to protect an Open Internet, where all data on the Internet is treated equally in terms of performance and access. The industry faces ongoing legislative and regulatory actions aimed at ensuring competition, which could limit the market share and growth potential of some larger players. Merger and acquisition activity by dominant market players has come under regulatory scrutiny. This has resulted in entities abandoning plans to consolidate, affecting their value. Strong reliance on market dominance can also be a source of risk if entities are vulnerable to legal challenges, increasing their risk profile and cost of capital."
Technology & Communications,Telecommunication Services,Product End-of-life Management,"Due to the rapid obsolescence of communications devices, particularly mobile phones, they represent an increasing proportion of electronic waste (e-waste) going to landfills, driven in part by a low recycling rate. Telecommunication services entities face growing regulatory risks related to this issue. Multiple jurisdictions have implemented e-waste recycling laws mandating that electronics retailers and manufacturers create a system for recycling, reuse, or proper disposal of electronic devices. While many of these laws in their early days covered a limited scope of products, newer laws extend to mobile devices requiring entities to finance the collection, treatment, recycling, or proper disposal of e-waste, as concerns around e-waste from communications devices increase. E-waste laws often require vendors or manufacturers to pay for the recycling of such waste or put in place product take-back and recycling programs. Penalties or costs, due to such laws, together with potential revenues generated from refurbishing and re-selling products, are increasingly providing incentives for entities in the industry to manage end-of-life impacts. Many telecommunication services entities work in partnership with phone manufacturers to bundle telecom services and mobile devices, and therefore have a shared responsibility for end-of-life management of such devices. Their relationship with customers provides an opportunity for effective management of product recycling, reuse, and disposal. Establishing take-back programs to recover end-of-life materials for further reuse, recycling, or remanufacturing can allow entities cost savings and more resilient supply of manufacturing materials."
Technology & Communications,Telecommunication Services,Environmental Footprint of Operations,"Individual telecommunication services entities consume substantial amounts of energy. Depending on the source of energy and generation efficiency, electricity consumption by telecom network infrastructure can contribute significantly toenvironmental externalities, such as climate change, creating sustainability risks for the industry. Although network equipment and data centres are becoming more energy efficient, their overall energy consumption is increasing with the expansion in telecommunications infrastructure and data traffic. How telecommunication services entities manage their overall energy efficiency or intensity, reliance on different types of energy, and how they access alternative sources of energy may become increasingly material as the global regulatory focus on climate change increases, creating incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy as well as pricing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because energy expenditures may be significant in the industry, entities that improve operational energy efficiency may increase cost savings and profit margins."
Technology & Communications,Telecommunication Services,Data Privacy,"As customers pay increased attention to privacy issues surrounding cell phone, internet, and email services, telecommunication services entities will have to implement strong management practices and guidelines related to their use of customer data. Telecommunication services entities use growing volumes of customer location, web browsing, anddemographic data to improve their services as well as to generate revenue by selling such data to third parties. Growing public concern about privacy has led to increased regulatory scrutiny over the use, collection, and sale of consumer data. These trends are increasing the importance to telecommunication services entities of adopting and communicating in a transparent manner policies about providing customer data to third parties, including the amount and type of data provided and the nature of its use (for example, use for commercial purposes). Additionally, telecommunication services entities receive, and must determine whether to comply with, government requests for customer information. Entities in the industry that fail to manage performance in this area are susceptible to decreased revenues as a result of lost consumer confidence and churn, as well as to financial impacts stemming from legal exposures.

Technology & Communications,Telecommunication Services,Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions,"Given the systemic importance of telecommunications networks, systemic or economy-wide disruption may result if the telecommunication services network infrastructure is unreliable and prone to business continuity risks. As the frequency ofextreme weather events associated with climate change increases, telecommunication services entities may face growing physical threats to network infrastructure, with potentially significant social or systemic impacts. In the absence of resilientand reliable infrastructure, entities may lose revenue associated with service disruptions or face unplanned capital expenditures to repair damaged or compromised equipment. Entities that successfully manage business continuity risks, including identifying critical business operations, and that enhance resilience of the system may substantially reduce their risk exposure and decrease their cost of capital. While implementation of such measures may have upfront costs, entities may gain long-term benefits in terms of lower remediation expenses in cases of high-impact disruptions."
Technology & Communications,Telecommunication Services,Data Security,"The Telecommunication Services industry is particularly vulnerable to data security threats, as entities manage an increasing volume of customer data, including personally identifiable information, as well as demographic, behavioural, and location data. Recent examples of cyber attacks on critical telecommunications infrastructure illustrate the need for enhanced network security. Inadequate prevention, detection, and remediation of data security threats can influence customer acquisition and retention and result in decreased market share and lower demand for the entity’s products. In addition to reputational damage and customer turnover, data breaches can also result in increased expenses, commonly associated with remediation efforts such as identity protection offerings and employee training on data protection. As theproviders of critical infrastructure, the ability of entities to combat cyber attacks is likely to affect reputation and brand value, with a long-term impact on market share and revenue growth potential. Therefore, entities that can identify and address data security risks in a timely manner are likely to be in a better position to protect market share and brand value while also reducing risk exposure to cyber attacks. Additionally, new and emerging data security standards and regulations are likely to affect the operating expenses of entities through increased costs of compliance."
Health Care,Managed Care,Climate Change Impacts on Human Health,"An increase in extreme weather events associated with climate change could have significant health impacts. These events, coupled with the potential spread of infectious diseases and food and water scarcity, may present material implications for the Managed Care industry through an increase in encounters with the health care system. Entities that manage the risks posed by extreme weather events and potential changes in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of illnesses and diseases may protect shareholder value better."
Health Care,Managed Care,Plan Performance,"Managed care entities manage performance in areas such as responsiveness, complaints, voluntary disenrollment, and customer service in order to maintain competitiveness. Under the Five-Star Quality Rating System for Medicare AdvantagePlans in the U.S., performance on key metrics are factored into federal reimbursement rates and bonus payments for Medicare Advantage carriers. Disclosure on key indicators related to plan performance may allow shareholders to understand how managed care entities are able to protect corporate value."
Health Care,Managed Care,Customer Privacy & Technology Standards,"Regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S., may require health insurance plans to comply with various requirements relating to the use, disclosure, storage, and transmission of patient health information. Entities in this industry are required to develop policies and technical safeguards to protect patient health information. A failure to comply with these evolving standards, which in the U.S. include provisions established under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, can lead to significant civil and criminal penalties. These risks are intensified by an increase in cyberattacks that target managed care entities."
Health Care,Managed Care,Access to Coverage,"Although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the U.S. reduced the number of uninsured, more than 10 percent of adults in the United States remain uninsured. The percentage of uninsured is significantly higher for people near or at the federal poverty level. Managed care entities can play a role in providing additional access by limiting plan costs and rate increases. Entities must also comply with regulations intended to control plan costs, including medical loss rations, while also ensuring coverage for all applicants regardless of health status, gender, or pre-existing conditions. Increased regulatory focus on health care costs and the need to comply with evolving regulations continue to present challenges for the industry."
Health Care,Managed Care,Improved Outcomes,"Managed care entities can play a critical role in maintaining and improving the health of enrollees. In addition, legislation continues to emphasise improved outcomes through provisions, including those that require health plans to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members. The development of the Five-Star Quality Rating System for Medicare Advantage Plans in the U.S., for example, further strengthens the relationship between enrollee health and value by linking reimbursement rates and bonus payments to performance in five domains, including specific outcome-based measures. Entities that are able to improve the health of enrollees may be better positioned to protect shareholder value."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Water Management,"Water is used in restaurant operations, from cooking and dishwashing to cleaning. The restaurant type, size and equipment all affect water use. Restaurants located in water-stressed regions may be exposed to water usage restrictions or face high water costs. Long-term historical increases in the costs of water, and expectations around continued increases because of overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth, pollution and climate change, indicate the increasing importance of effective water management. Entities can reduce water use and associated operational costs by implementing water-efficient practices and using water-efficient commercial kitchen equipment."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Food Safety,"Both food preparation methods and quality of ingredients can impact food safety in the Restaurants industry. Restaurant food safety is especially challenging to manage with a broad supply chain. The global nature of the industry as well as thefranchising model make it difficult for restaurant entities to ensure the safety of their food supplies. Failure to monitor thequality of supplied products may increase an entity’s risk of supply disruptions as well as negative publicity. Food safety issues, such as foodborne illness concerns, in either entity-owned or franchise-operated locations can affect the core of a restaurant’s reputation. Reputational damage from food safety issues tends to have a long-term impact. Entities that adhere to industry standards for food preparation and safety are likely to be better positioned to protect shareholder value."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Food & Packaging Waste Management,"Restaurants produce waste in two main forms: food and packaging. Food waste is generated during the preparation process as well as by unconsumed food. Food waste results in loss of resources, such as water, energy, land, labour, and capital, and produces GHG emissions as a result of decomposition. Moreover, food ingredient deliveries to restaurants are a significant source of packaging waste. Packaging waste includes packaging received from suppliers and packaging disposed by consumers in the restaurant areas. In addition, limited-service restaurants make heavy use of disposable tableware to serve customers. Municipal and federal regulations around packaging are likely to continue evolving to reduce packaging or improve recyclability or biodegradability of packaging. Entities that are able to stay ahead of regulations will not only see a positive impact on brand reputation, but will likely reduce their cost of compliance. Entities that are able to reduce waste through various methods, including food recovery, diverting waste from landfills, and packaging reclamation programs, can reduce waste handling costs and improve operational efficiency."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Nutritional Content,"Public health concerns around obesity have put the Restaurant industry under a spotlight. Restaurants are increasingly pressured to improve the nutritional content of menu offerings and to increase transparency around the content of menu offerings, such as publishing calorie counts. Demand in the Restaurant industry is increasingly driven by consumer preferences for choices that are more healthful. Entities that are able to offer more nutritious menu options are likely to capture new markets for health-conscious consumers and improve market share with consumers. A higher share of nutritious options may have a beneficial effect on an entity’s reputation and revenue growth in the long term."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Energy Management,"Restaurant operations have high energy intensity compared with other commercial building operations. Commercial kitchen appliances are energy intensive, and dining areas typically are temperature-controlled for customers. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change andair pollution, which have the potential indirectly, yet materially, to affect restaurant operations. Regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing or regulatory incentives for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy affect conventional and renewable energy prices. Entities that manage energy consumption at entity-owned and franchise locations can decrease operational costs through energy efficiency upgrades and limit exposure to GHG emissions regulations by using renewable energy resources."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Supply Chain Management & Food Sourcing,"Restaurants source ingredients and products from a wide range of suppliers. Supply chain management is crucial for restaurants to ensure food safety, to protect their reputations and increase revenue. Sourcing quality ingredients to maintain a consistent level of quality across different locations can be operationally challenging and exacerbated by the global nature of the industry. Demand from the food and beverage industry, including restaurants, drives and shapes agricultural production, indicating that actions by industry players have a larger impact on society. Therefore, sustainable and ethical sourcing by industry entities may be necessary to ensure future supply and to minimise lifecycle impacts of entity operations. Sourcing from suppliers that have high quality standards, employ environmentally sustainable farming methods, and honour labour rights may better create value over the long-term. By increasing the amount of food supply sourced in conformance with environmental and social standards, as well as conformance with animal welfare standards and best practices, restaurant operators may be able to maintain food quality, manage food safety issues, enhance their reputation and expand their market share."
Food & Beverage,Restaurants,Labour Practices,"The Restaurant industry is labour-intensive, and many of the staff are hourly, part-time, or seasonal workers. The industry is among the top job creators and is an entry point for young and migrant workers to join the workforce. Restaurant employees in franchised or licensed locations may be employed by a third party. In addition, since many restaurant chains exist across continents, ensuring consistent labour standards can be a challenge for restaurant employees in both entity-owned and franchise locations. Labour issues at franchises affect brand image because customers cannot make a distinction between entity-owned and franchised restaurants. Restaurants that are able to properly manage human capital by offering competitive wages, safe working environments, and other opportunities for professional growth will likely improve employee morale while reducing turnover rates and the associated administrative costs involved in employee acquisition and training."
Transportation,Rail Transportation,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The Rail Transportation industry generates emissions mainly through the combustion of diesel in locomotive engines. Despite relatively low emissions compared to other transportation industries, fuel management has implications for industry entities in terms of operating costs and regulatory compliance. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO2) are of particular importance to government regulators concerned about climate change. Intensifying regulation of locomotive exhaust emissions and high fuel costs encourage rail entities to invest in fuel efficiency enhancements to manage emissions. These investments can improve an entity’s operational efficiency and cost structure, with effects on value and competitive position both within the industry and compared to other modes of transport."
Transportation,Rail Transportation,Air Quality,"Rail operations emit several types of air pollutants that are regulated under national and international laws, including hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), criteria air pollutants (CAPs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants tend to have localised environmental and health impacts. For example, locomotive engines idling at rail yards may be a health concern for nearby human populations as HAPs such as benzene are known human carcinogens, while nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a major component of smog and acid rain. At the same time, fuel is a significant industry cost. Rail entities that implement fuel efficiency enhancements and manage emissions may see impacts to their costs in both the short and longer term."
Transportation,Rail Transportation,Competitive Behaviour,"Industry consolidation and prior allegations of anti-competitive practices in relation to captive shippers, among other reasons, create pressure on antitrust immunity granted to railroads in some regions. Some of the proposed policy changescould lead to significant costs or impede investment in the industry. Rail entities operating at the limits of allowable charges in areas where they could be found to have market dominance, or those not complying with regulations about reasonable rates, are likely to face increased regulatory scrutiny. Any associated fines or penalties may negatively affect anentity’s valuation by increasing its cost of capital. In an environment of increased concerns about the market power and pricing practices of rail entities, it is in their interest to continue to ensure competitive pricing and transparency in rate-setting while achieving adequate returns on their investments."
Transportation,Rail Transportation,Employee Health & Safety,"Moving freight by rail is associated with the risk of accidents and unintended releases of hazardous materials. These can harm the health and well-being of employees as well as have negative financial impacts on entities, such as reduced productivity, higher employee turnover, and increased insurance costs. Rail operators are likely to be impacted by accidents, and in some cases, poor health may also cause accidents. A healthy workforce, strong safety culture, thorough and systematic approach to safety, risk management programs (including emergency preparedness and response), and operational integrity at all levels of an entity can help lower the probability and magnitude of rail accidents."
Transportation,Rail Transportation,Accident & Safety Management,"Rail accidents and unintended releases of hazardous materials can have repercussions for the environment and communities along railroad tracks, as well as financial impacts on entities themselves. Increasingly stringent safety regulations and the potential for significant costs following major accidents provide incentives for entities to manage theirsafety performance through a robust safety management system. In addition, the loss of consumer confidence after such events can result in lower revenues and potentially damage an entity’s social license to operate, increasing its cost of capital."
Consumer Goods,"Apparel, Accessories & Footwear",Labour Conditions in the Supply Chain,"The treatment of workers and the protection of worker rights in the Apparel, Accessories, & Footwear industry’s supply chain is of growing concern among consumers, regulators, and leading entities. Critical aspects of this issue include employee health and safety, fair pay, child labour, and forced labour. Although entities continue to improve performance on this issue, the industry’s reliance on a multitiered system of suppliers, subcontractors, labour recruitment firms, and part-time workers makes it difficult to manage. Because entities in the industry typically contract with suppliers in countries with the lowest direct costs, the industry’s products are often manufactured in countries that have limited regulations or enforcement protecting workers. This dynamic can heighten an entity’s exposure to reputational risks and impacts on short- and long-term costs and sales. Such effects can arise from increasing regulation and its enforcement in response to high-profile safety or labour incidents, production disruptions due to strikes and other labour-related work stoppages, or through a shift in demand away from entities associated with such incidents. Entities with strong supply chain standards, monitoring, and engagement with suppliers to address labour concerns may therefore be better positioned to protect shareholder value over the long term."
Consumer Goods,"Apparel, Accessories & Footwear",Raw Materials Sourcing,"The Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry relies on many raw materials including cotton, leather, wool, rubber, and precious minerals and metals, as inputs for finished products. Sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity and conflict in regions where the industry’s supply chain operates affect the industry’s ability to reliably source materials. The ability of entities to manage potential material shortages, supply disruptions, price volatility and reputational risks can be more difficult when supply chains lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue can delay shipments and depress earnings, reduce margins, constrain revenue growth or increase costs of capital. The types ofrisk associated with sourcing different materials can require different solutions, including engaging with suppliers, enhancing transparency by using certification standards, using innovative alternative materials, or introducing circular economy practices. Entities that are proactive may reduce their exposure to price volatility and potential supply disruptions, while improving their brand reputation and developing new market opportunities."
Consumer Goods,"Apparel, Accessories & Footwear",Management of Chemicals in Products,"The introduction of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals legislation in the EU demonstrates increasing regulatory and stakeholder concern surrounding the use of harmful or potentially harmful substances in consumer products, including apparel, accessories, and footwear. Finished apparel and footwear products have been found to contain traces of chemicals that have been banned or regulated. Depending on the chemical, the amount present in a product, and the type of exposure that consumers face, specific substances can be carcinogenic, and can disrupt hormone activity in humans and other organisms. Failure to manage this issue may generate additional regulatory oversight and impact an entity’s social license to operate. In addition, the presence of harmful chemicals in products can lead to recalls, litigation, and reputational damage. Entities in this industry can work in both the design and manufacturing phases to manage the use of chemicals of concern, develop safe alternatives, and eliminate those that have been banned. Given the industry’s reliance on outsourced manufacturing, this involves proactive partnerships with suppliers. In managing this issue, entities must balance the hazard posed to consumers presented by certain chemicals with the quality of a product and its costs of production. "
Consumer Goods,"Apparel, Accessories & Footwear",Environmental Impacts in the Supply Chain,"The Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry’s global supply chain contributes significantly to environmental externalities through water consumption and pollution, as well as air pollution. Water pollution results from the discharge of chemicalsduring water-intensive dyeing and tanning processes, while air pollution stems from the industry’s energy use. These impacts have the potential to damage an entity’s reputation and to affect cost structures over time. The scale of this issue has historically been intensified by the fact that the industry relies on manufacturing partners in emerging markets where environmental regulations and oversight are limited. However, enhanced scrutiny on the part of stakeholders and consumers, coupled with the development of more stringent regulation in certain regions, has led entities throughout theindustry to work with suppliers to reduce their environmental impact. Apparel, accessories, and footwear entities that leverage their market power to work with suppliers to improve operational efficiencies and resource consumption and limit pollution will be able to mitigate costs associated with increased resource scarcity and regulation. Further, those that engage with suppliers through monitoring, auditing, and strict standards will likely be better positioned to protect shareholder value over the long term."
Health Care,Drug Retailers,Patient Health Outcomes,"Drug retailers and pharmacists play an important role in the health care system, as they provide patients with medications and are often the last health care professionals to interact and engage with patients before medications are consumed. Drug retailers can enhance patient outcomes by improving communication, avoiding dispensing errors, and raising patients’ drug-adherence rates. Pharmacies have the opportunity to engage and educate patients on the importance of adhering to prescriptions, which provides beneficial outcomes for patients as well as for businesses. Entities that ensure the effective management of these interactions while working to avoid dispensing errors may be better positioned to protect shareholder value. "
Health Care,Drug Retailers,Energy Management in Retail,"Chain drug retailers operate thousands of locations that consume large quantities of energy. Electricity is used primarily for lighting and refrigeration. Many retail locations may operate 24 hours a day, thereby increasing energy demand. Operational energy efficiency and diversification among a range of energy supply sources may mitigate exposure to rising energy costs and limit an entity’s indirect greenhouse gas emissions."
Health Care,Drug Retailers,Drug Supply Chain Integrity,"The drug retailer industry supply chain is long and complex, consisting of distribution networks between manufacturers and retailers. The ability of entities to ensure the quality and safety of pharmaceutical and healthcare products is critical tobrand value. The industry faces risks associated with counterfeit drugs, and effective supply chain management is essential in mitigating these challenges. Drug retailers that fail to manage their supply chains may incur costs related to recalls, and such incidents may present significant risks to customers. The importance of this issue is elevated by the prevalence of store-brand products, which constitute a growing portion of drugstore sales."
Health Care,Drug Retailers,Management of Controlled Substances,"Drug retailers are distributors and sellers of a wide variety of controlled substances. In the U.S., the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) defines requirements for recordkeeping, distribution, dispensing, disposal, and security of controlled substances. Within this industry, the high volumes of drugs processed and dispensed, along with the extensive retail and distribution networks of larger entities, heighten the risk of theft, loss, and illegal drug dispensing. These actions may result in adverse social externalities, including public health consequences related to drug abuse and the illicit drug trade. Drug retailers participate in statewide drug monitoring programs to help mitigate some of the social issues associated with dispensing controlled substances. Furthermore, regulatory enforcement of the CSA requirements can result in fines and license suspensions. Strong internal management of controlled substances can mitigate these risks and help protect shareholder value in the long term."
Health Care,Drug Retailers,Data Security & Privacy,"Drug retailers, as distributors of prescription medication and operators of retail health clinics, have access to and manage protected health information. Entities often have a legal obligation to safeguard their customers’ information, a task that includes the proper handling of sensitive information by staff in pharmacies and clinics, as well as the safe storage of information on physical and electronic media. Cyberattacks may compromise health information that is stored electronically, along with customers’ financial and personal data. Drug retailers that prevent major data breaches, including point-of-sales breaches and cyber attacks, can avoid harming brand value, reduce contingent liabilities, and maintain market share."
Services,Casinos & Gaming,Internal Controls on Money Laundering,"By the nature of its business, the Casinos & Gaming industry can be attractive to criminals seeking to launder money or disguise the origin of funds. Risk factors include the large amount of cash transactions, accessibility to multiple facilities, and customer anonymity. Therefore, strict and robust internal controls are necessary for entities to prevent violations of reporting and money laundering regulations. Casino operators that fail to detect and prevent money laundering activities may open themselves to investigations. Violations of anti-money laundering laws and regulations could result in criminal prosecution and/or substantial regulatory penalties."
Services,Casinos & Gaming,Responsible Gaming,"While the main purpose of gambling is entertainment, the industry faces a negative perception that is often related to pathological gambling. In addition to pathological gambling which is a progressive addiction characterised by increasing preoccupation with gambling, customers may also experience problem gambling, a less severe form of pathological gambling. While casinos do not cause problem gambling, they provide opportunities to gamble and may earn disproportionately greater revenue from pathological and problem gamblers. Responsible gambling encompasses industrybest practices to mitigate the impacts of problem gambling that may result from violations of self-exclusion lists, irresponsible advertising, gambling by minors, or instances where the entity has otherwise enabled gambling problems. Highly-publicised incidents related to pathological and problem gambling may damage entities’ reputations and result in regulatory curtailment of their licenses to operate. "
Services,Casinos & Gaming,Energy Management,"With many facilities open 24 hours a day, the Casinos & Gaming industry requires a large amount of energy to operate. Casino facilities often have few windows and therefore rely on their buildings’ mechanical systems for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, and have the potential to impact casino entities’ results of operations. Entities that rely on electricity consumption for their operations increasingly must manage energy efficiency as well as energy availability, including the risks and opportunities associated with energy sourcing from fossil fuels or from renewable and alternative energy sources."
Services,Casinos & Gaming,Smoke-free Casinos,"Casino facilities are usually climate-controlled environments with internal air circulation, and have a relatively high concentration of employees and customers. While anti-smoking campaigns have helped some regions enact smoking bans for public places, many casinos remain exempt from such bans. Smoke exposes employees and customers to risks of heart attacks and cancer. In addition, studies have shown that casino dealers exposed to secondhand smoke have higher-than-average rates of respiratory illness. Entities that derive a significant portion of their revenue from smoking customersmay be negatively affected by smoking bans, which are becoming more common. Alternatively, by creating smoke-free facilities, casino operators may be better positioned to attract more non-smoking patrons."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Climate Change Impacts on Human Health & Infrastructure,"An increase in extreme weather events associated with climate change may present physical threats to health care deliveryfacilities and create challenges in serving affected populations. Coupled with the potential spread of infectious diseases and food and water scarcity, these events may present material implications for the Health Care Delivery industry."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Access for Low-Income Patients,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) expanded the number of insured individuals. However, more than 10 percent of the adults in the U.S. remain uninsured. Health care delivery entities will continue to face challenges associated with serving uninsured and low-income patients. These challenges are likely to be compounded by reductions in Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. Disclosure on how entities manage the provision of care to uninsured populations and shifting DSH allocations will allow shareholders to understand the associated risks and opportunities. "
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Quality of Care & Patient Satisfaction,"The ability to deliver quality care and ensure patient satisfaction is an essential value driver for health care delivery entities.The link between performance in this area and shareholder value was strengthened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Included in the Act’s provisions, is the establishment of the Hospital Value-Based PurchasingProgram, which provides incentive payments, based on performance on a series of health care quality measures. In addition, the PPACA created programs that reduce inpatient payments for hospitals with excessive readmissions rates and hospital-acquired conditions."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Patient Privacy & Electronic Health Records,"The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires health care providers to establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of patient health information. Failure to comply with such regulations can lead to civil and criminal penalties. The extent and enforcement of these fines was strengthened by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The ARRA also established financial incentivesfor the meaningful use of electronic health records, as well as reduced Medicare payments for entities that fail to demonstrate meaningful use. Although meaningful use was supplanted by Promoting Interoperability by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), financial incentives and penalties remain tied to the effective use of electronic health records. As legislative efforts continue to promote the use of electronic health records and health care delivery entities face increasing threats related to cybersecurity, disclosure on the use of electronic health records and datasecurity will allow shareholders to monitor performance in these areas."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Energy Management,"Health Care Delivery entities operate energy-intensive facilities and rely on both purchased electricity and fuel. The consumption of both can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Legislative attempts to limit these impacts and to incentivise energy efficiency and renewable energy may result in price volatility associated with fossil fuels and conventional electricity. Entities that improve energy efficiency may decrease costs and limit exposure to energy price fluctuations."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Management of Controlled Substances,"The Health Care Delivery industry is in a unique position with respect to the evolving opioid epidemic in the U.S. As one of the largest prescribers of opioids, the industry has contributed to an increase in the use of these substances and subsequently to a rise in addiction levels. As the providers of care, the industry also treats individuals who are suffering from addiction and related health concerns. Although health care delivery entities do not typically face direct costs associated with the prescription of opioids, they face significant costs in addressing the health care needs of those suffering from addiction and related illnesses. Industry-wide efforts to reevaluate approaches to pain management through the development of new policies, training, and oversight may have financially material impacts. "
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Fraud & Unnecessary Procedures,"Health care delivery entities in the U.S. are subject to significant fines and penalties under the Federal False Claims Act and similar state laws. Entities that receive at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees and contractors regarding false claims, false statements, and whistleblower protections under these laws. The ability to ensure compliance in this area may have material implications for health delivery entities."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Pricing & Billing Transparency,"In the U.S., concern over pricing and billing transparency in the Health Care Delivery industry has led to numerous legislative efforts at both the state and federal level. More than 40 states report information on charges or payment rates,and make the information available to the public. For hospitals accepting Medicare patients, the Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides average charges per patient and average Medicare payments for the 30 most common ambulatory procedures and the most frequent diagnosis-related groups. Beginning in 2019, CMS is also likely to require that hospitals publish a list of their current standard charges online, and that these charges be updated annually. This would strengthen requirements established in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and be similar to existing requirements in numerous states. These legislative and regulatory efforts, coupled with increased emphasis on health care cost containment, may enhance scrutiny on the pricing and billing practices of entities in this industry. Firms that are able to achieve compliance and transparent pricing structures may be better positioned to protect shareholder value."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Employee Health & Safety,"The Health Care Delivery industry is heavily dependent on a skilled workforce, and employees are routinely exposed to injury, illness, and infection during their regular duties. Relative to other industries, Health Care Delivery has one of the highest rates of injury and illness. Entities that are able to manage this issue more effectively can reduce costs associated with workers’ compensation, productivity, morale, and employee retention. Entities often mitigate risks by implementing proactive health and safety management protocols, developing training requirements for employees, and conducting regular audits of their own practices."
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,"Employee Recruitment, Development & Retention","Health care delivery entities will continue to face increased competition for physicians due to increased demand which is intensified by current and future shortages. The ongoing ability to recruit, develop, and retain health care practitioners is critical to success in this industry and disclosure on related performance indicators allows shareholders to understand howentities are managing this important human capital issue. "
Health Care,Health Care Delivery,Waste Management,"Health Care Delivery entities generate a significant amount of regulated medical and pharmaceutical waste. Disposal fees for these types of waste are typically higher than that of conventional waste and may present a significant cost for the industry. Entities that reduce the amount of waste generated by enhanced waste segregation strategies, recycling and reuse may limit their exposure to these costs."
Infrastructure,Home Builders,Land Use & Ecological Impacts,"Home builders face risks associated with the ecological impacts of development activities. Developments often take place on previously undeveloped land, and entities must manage the ecosystem disruption of construction activities as well as the regulations and permitting processes that accompany 'greenfield' land development. Regardless of the siting decisionsentities make, industry development activities generally carry risks related to land and water contamination, mismanagement of waste, and excessive strain on water resources during the construction and use phases. Violation of environmental regulations can result in costly fines and delays that decrease financial returns while potentially harming brand value. Entities with repeated violations or a history of negative ecological impacts may find seeking permits and approvals from local communities for new developments difficult, thereby decreasing future revenue and market share. Entities that concentrate development efforts in water-stressed regions may witness challenges to permitting approvals and increased land or home value depreciation because of water shortage concerns. Environmental quality control procedures, 'smart growth' strategies (including a focus on redevelopment sites) and conservation strategies may help ensure compliance with environmental laws, and therefore mitigate financial risks, while improving future growth opportunities."
Infrastructure,Home Builders,Design for Resource Efficiency,"Residential buildings, when occupied, consume significant amounts of energy and water. Entities in the Home Builders industry can improve home resource efficiency through sustainable design practices and choice of materials. Energy-saving products and techniques such as designing homes for efficient heating and cooling may reduce energy dependence, whether it comes from the electric grid or onsite fuel combustion. Intended to improve home resource efficiency, these measures may decrease home ownership costs through lower utility bills. Water-saving features such as low-flow faucets alleviate stress in water-scarce communities, while likely also reducing homeowner costs. Homebuyer awareness of energy and water efficiency creates an opportunity for entities to increase target market demand, thereby increasing revenue or margins. Effectively applying resource efficiency design principles in a cost-effective manner may be a competitive advantage, especially when entities are successful in systematically educating customers on the long-term benefits of these homes."
Infrastructure,Home Builders,Community Impacts of New Developments,"Community and urban planning gives home builders the opportunity to thoughtfully design new residential developmentsin a way that benefits their customers as well as the pre-existing surrounding community. New home development can bring economic growth and workforce opportunities while moderating cost-of-living increases, and can provide communities with safe and vibrant neighbourhoods. Entities may strive to improve communities’ environmental and socialimpacts by providing access to public transportation and/or not overburdening existing transportation or utilities infrastructure, providing access to green spaces, developing mixed-use spaces, and creating more walkable communities. These strategies can help increase the overall demand for and selling prices of homes as well as reduce the risks related topermitting and community or stakeholder opposition related to current or future developments. When entities use development strategies that inadequately integrate their new communities into the pre-existing surrounding communities, they risk insufficient sales prices, excessive costs related to infrastructure needs and assessments, and risk being permitting approvals, delays, and/or community support for future developments."
Infrastructure,Home Builders,Climate Change Adaptation,"The impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and changing climate patterns, may affect the markets entities select to develop homes and residential communities. Entities with business models that incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and adapt to such risks, are likely to grow entity value more effectively over the long term, partially through reductions in risk. More specifically, strategies focused on home development activities in floodplains and coastal regions exposed to extreme weather events, such as flooding, have increased the need to adapt to climate change, especially considering long-term challenges like flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidised flood insurance programs, permitting approvals and financing stipulations. Rising climate risks may translate into reduced long-term demand, land value depreciation and concerns over understated long-term costs of home ownership. Additionally, entities that build developments in water-stressed regions risk losing land value and may have problems getting permitting approvals. The active assessment of climate change risks and a holistic view of long-term homebuyer demand may enable entities to successfully adapt to such risks."
Infrastructure,Home Builders,Workforce Health & Safety,"Home construction requires a significant amount of manual labour from entity employees and subcontractors. Site excavation and home construction activities are physically demanding, exposing workers to risks from falls and heavy machinery, and resulting in relatively high injury and fatality rates. Worker injuries and fatalities have internal and external costs that can significantly impact the results of their operations and their social license to operate. Impacts include fines, penalties, workers' compensation costs, regulatory compliance costs from more stringent oversight, higher insurance premiums, and project delays and downtime. To avoid such costs, entities can foster a culture of safety by developing proactive safety management plans, training employees and contractors, and conducting regular audits."
Services,Media & Entertainment,Media Pluralism,"Media pluralism, which is diversity in the broadest sense, includes both external and internal pluralism. External pluralism refers to media ownership, independent editorial boards, channels, titles, or programs. Internal pluralism refers to the social, racial/ethnic, and political diversity represented in media content. Media and entertainment entities can ensure pluralism by maintaining on- and off-screen diversity and by safeguarding the independence of editorial boards and programming."
Services,Media & Entertainment,Intellectual Property Protection & Media Piracy,"Entities in this industry rely on their intellectual property (IP) to generate revenue. However, while IP protection is inherent to their business model, strong IP protections may sometimes conflict with the interests of society. Proponents of IP protection assert its importance as a driver of innovation. Opponents argue that assigning ownership can stifle innovationand competition by enabling the creation of monopolies. Despite the industry’s best efforts, media piracy is rampant and entities devote significant resources to protecting and enforcing their IP rights. Media and entertainment entities thereforemust balance protecting their intellectual property with ensuring access to media and allowing fair use."
Services,Media & Entertainment,Journalistic Integrity & Sponsorship Identification,"Audiences rely on journalists for accurate and timely information on current events. Principles of journalism include accuracy, fairness, minimization of harm, independence, accountability, and transparency. Failure to adhere to these principles can affect the credibility of not only the journalist, but also of the entity responsible for publishing or broadcasting these materials. As regulations around the disclosure of sponsorship and endorsement evolve, transparency is important for both journalism and entertainment content."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Hazardous Waste Management,"Solar panel manufacturing may involve the use of hazardous substances that can cause adverse health and environmentalimpacts if not properly managed. Common thin-film technologies can utilise materials including cadmium, gallium arsenide, and copper indium gallium (di)selenide, which require careful handling during the manufacturing process and disposal. The handling and disposal of hazardous wastes produced during manufacturing can lead to operating costs, capital expenditures, and in some instances result in regulatory costs. As such, effective management of hazardous materials, including through reduction, reuse, recycling, and safe storage and disposal, can lower operating costs and mitigate potential regulatory penalties or reputational damage."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Regulations,"Entities in the industry have faced challenges in establishing solar energy as a cost-competitive means of energy production and GHG reduction, and they have encountered difficulty in capturing a greater market share of global energygeneration. To promote greater adoption of solar, the industry may benefit by preventing systemic disruptions to the existing energy infrastructure and essential energy services. Entities are innovating to overcome the technical challenges of increasing solar integration with the grid. They also are engaging regulatory agencies and policymakers to reduce regulatory barriers to solar energy adoption, many of which are emerging because of concerns regarding increasing overall grid electricity costs and grid disruptions. Solar entities are investing in innovative technologies to reduce hardwareand installation costs, and they are pursuing business-model innovation to reduce the cost of capital and facilitate the purchase of solar energy systems. Solar technology entities may improve their competitiveness through deploying one or more of these strategies successfully to ensure their ability to scale over the long term."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Product End-of-life Management,"Solar panels may contain hazardous substances as well as reusable materials of high economic value. Given the rapid expansion of solar energy globally, increasing volumes of solar panels are expected to reach the end of their useful life in the medium term. In some regions, including parts of the EU, manufacturers are required by law to take financial responsibility for their products at the end-of-life stage, including collection and recycling. Product take-back, recycling, and disposal may result in higher upfront investments or capital expenditures for operators in the industry. However, as more modules reach the end of their life and this issue likely receives more legislative attention, entities may differentiate themselves through offering product take-back and recycling services. This could increase revenues as well as result in lower long-term costs by reusing recovered materials in manufacturing processes."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Water Management in Manufacturing,"Solar photovoltaic panel manufacturing can be water-intensive, and ultra-pure water is a critical input in some processes. The manufacturing process also may generate wastewater, which must be treated before disposal or reuse, and therefore may result in incremental operating costs and capital expenditures. Furthermore, depending on the location, solar equipment manufacturing facilities may face water scarcity and related cost increases or operational disruptions. Water resource use may generate tension with local water users and associated risks, potentially disrupting manufacturing operations and adversely affecting brand value. To mitigate water supply and treatment risks, entities may adopt various strategies such as recycling process water, improving production techniques to lower water intensity, and improving watertreatment systems."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Energy Management in Manufacturing,"Solar panel manufacturing typically uses electrical energy purchased from the grid. Energy can account for a considerable share of the total cost of production. Considering rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future offossil-based energy, entities that diversify their energy sources may manage the associated risks and maintain a reliable energy supply more effectively. Entities that minimise energy use through effective energy management may reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage through operational efficiency and competitive pricing of products. Competitively priced products are particularly important given the intense price competition within the solar technology industry."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Materials Sourcing,"Solar technology entities typically source numerous materials including polysilicon, metals, glass, and electrical components. Entities additionally utilise certain materials that are critical to solar panel and module manufacturing. Limited global resources of these critical materials, as well as their concentration in countries that may have relatively limited governance and regulatory structures or are subject to geopolitical tensions, expose entities to the risk of supply-chain disruptions and input-price increases or volatility. Entities can mitigate associated risks by ensuring transparency in their supply chains, working actively to source materials from reliable suppliers or regions that have minimal environmental or social risks, and supporting research for alternative inputs."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Ecological Impacts of Project Development,"Many large, publicly listed solar technology entities are involved in project development, including the evaluation and acquisition of land rights, site permitting, and engagement with stakeholders. Successful development is contingent on securing the approval of environmental permits and the permission of local governments and communities. Siting of medium or large solar installations in ecologically sensitive areas, including endangered species habitats, can render environmental permitting more difficult and costly. Project development may also be affected by local land-use laws and community opposition to projects due to their land footprint or concerns over impacts on local water resources. These factors can slow or disrupt the development process, possibly resulting in higher costs, lost revenues, or project delays. Entities with robust strategies for environmental impact assessment and mitigation can reduce the risk of project delays, increasing the likelihood of timely project completion."
Transportation,Automobiles,Product Safety,"Driving is a risky activity, as factors such as distracted driving, speeding, drunk driving, and dangerous weather conditions can lead to accidents that expose drivers, passengers, and bystanders to possible injuries and deaths. Accidents can also be caused by defective vehicles, and failure to detect defects before vehicles are sold can have significant financial repercussions for auto manufacturers. Defective vehicles sold in many countries that do not meet safety requirements must be recalled and repaired or replaced at the manufacturer’s cost. Recalls can result in reputational damage, which canreduce revenues and growth potential while increasing an entity’s risk profile and thus its cost of capital. Ensuring vehicle safety and responding in a timely manner when defects are identified can protect entities from regulatory action or customer lawsuits, which may result in significant costs that can erode industry margins. Through effective management of the issue, entities can enhance their brand value and drive higher sales over the long term."
Transportation,Automobiles,Materials Sourcing,"Entities in the Automobiles industry commonly rely on rare earth metals and other critical materials as key inputs. Many ofthese inputs have few or no available substitutes and are often sourced from deposits concentrated in a few countries, many of which are subject to geopolitical uncertainty. Other sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry’s supply chain operates are also increasingly shaping the industry’s ability to source materials. Additionally, increased competition for these materials due to growing global demand from other sectors can result in price increases and supply risks. These materials play a crucial role in clean energytechnologies, such as electric and hybrid vehicles. As regulators aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and consumer demand grows for more fuel-efficient vehicles, the share of hybrids and zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) produced by the Automobiles industry is likely to continue to increase in the future. Entities that are able to limit the use of critical materials, secure their sourcing, and develop alternatives will protect themselves from supply disruptions and volatile input prices, which may impact their margins, risk profile and cost of capital."
Transportation,Automobiles,Materials Efficiency & Recycling,"Auto manufacturing involves the use of significant amounts of materials (including steel, iron, aluminium, and plastics) and can generate substantial amounts of waste (including scrap metal, paint sludge, and shipping materials). As the rate of vehicle ownership expands globally and millions of vehicles reach the end of their useful lives every year, the lifecycle environmental impacts of automobiles are increasing. Automobile entities can use design innovation as well as process and technological improvements to mitigate these impacts and achieve material financial benefits. Entities that innovate to improve materials efficiency in their production processes, including reducing waste and reusing or recycling waste andscrapped vehicles, can contribute to lowering the lifecycle environmental impacts of vehicles and the strain on natural resources from the production of new materials. Through such innovation, entities can achieve cost savings by lowering input costs and protect themselves from potential regulatory fines or penalties. They can also protect themselves from fluctuations in the prices and availability of key inputs into their production process that may arise from resource scarcity."
Transportation,Automobiles,Fuel Economy & Use-phase Emissions,"Motor vehicle fossil fuel combustion accounts for a significant share of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contributing to global climate change. Engine exhaust also generates local air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM), which can threaten human health and the environment. In this context, vehicle emissions increasingly concern consumers and regulators around the world. Although use-phase emissions are downstream from auto manufacturers, regulations often focus on auto manufacturers to reduce these emissions, such as through fuel economy standards. More stringent emissions standards and changing consumer demands are driving electric vehicle and hybrid market expansion, as well as for high fuel-efficiency conventional vehicles. Moreover, manufacturers are designing innovative vehicles made with lighter-weight materials to improve fuel efficiency. Entities that meet current fuel-efficiency and emissions standards and continue to innovate to meet or exceed future regulatory standards in various markets may strengthen their competitive position and expand their market share, while mitigating the risk of reduced demand for conventional vehicles."
Transportation,Automobiles,Labour Practices,"Many workers in the Automobiles industry are covered under collective bargaining agreements that cover fair wages, safeworking conditions, and freedom of association, which are among basic worker rights. Meanwhile, due to the global nature of the industry, auto entities may also operate in countries where worker rights are not adequately protected. Effective management of, and communication regarding, issues such as worker pay and working conditions can prevent conflicts with workers that could lead to extended periods of strikes, which can slow or shut down manufacturing, reducerevenues, and raise operational risk. Auto manufacturers that manage workers in a way that protects worker rights may face higher labour costs in the short term, but may be better positioned to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of their operations by enhancing worker productivity. "
Consumer Goods,Building Products & Furnishings,Wood Supply Chain Management,"The Building Products & Furnishings industry uses large amounts of wood sourced from forests worldwide. Unsustainable production and timber harvesting can result in adverse environmental and social impacts, including biodiversity loss and harm to the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Entities inadvertently may source wood from areas susceptible to unsustainable forestry practices. Reports of illegal logging, environmental pollution or adverse impacts on communities can result in reputational repercussions that can damage an entity’s brand value, affecting demand for their products. In addition, regulations banning the importation of illegally produced wood can result in supply constraints, penalties and further damage to brand value. To mitigate these risks, entities increasingly are adopting third-party certifications verifyingwood is grown and harvested in a sustainable manner. Obtaining wood sourcing certifications also can provide entities with a potential growth channel because they can satisfy customer demand for certified products."
Consumer Goods,Building Products & Furnishings,Management of Chemicals in Products,"The Building Products & Furnishings industry's products may contain substances that have the potential to harm human health, including volatile organic compounds and potential reproductive toxins, carcinogens, and endocrine disruptors. In general, these substances are found in products at low concentrations, if at all, and therefore do not pose a health concern. Nonetheless, the industry is exposed to potentially significant regulatory and reputational risk as a result of the use of substances of concern. Actual or perceived human health risks create the potential for future regulation around product chemical content and possible reputational impacts for entities, which can significantly affect demand for products. Increasing consumer concern over chemical use is driving the industry’s voluntary efforts to eliminate such chemicals from products and use alternative materials. The continued adoption of building certification standards such as LEED are driving demand for products with reduced chemical content. Entities that effectively manage harmful chemicals in their products may enjoy a competitive advantage over the long term through higher demand, reduced regulatory risk, and improved brand value."
Consumer Goods,Building Products & Furnishings,Product Lifecycle Environmental Impacts,"Depending on the specific building product or furnishing, significant environmental impacts can arise during raw material sourcing, transportation, manufacturing, use-phase or end-of-life. Increasing consumer and regulatory preference for less impactful products has spawned the development of more sustainable products, broadly termed ‘green building materials’. In addition, product lifecycle certification has arisen as a tool for entities and their customers to assess and improve a product’s lifecycle impact. Certification programmes typically examine specific sustainability characteristics of a product category and include the use of closed-loop materials that minimise a product’s end-of-life environmental impactsand reduce the need for extracting or producing virgin materials. Through product innovation and design that facilitates end-of-life product recovery and the use of less impactful materials, the adoption of product certification programmes, and partnerships with customers, manufacturers of building products can improve lifecycle impacts, reduce regulatory risk, meet growing customer demand and realise cost savings."
Consumer Goods,Building Products & Furnishings,Energy Management in Manufacturing,"The Building Products & Furnishings industry creates value through energy-intensive manufacturing processes. Purchased electricity represents the largest share of energy consumption across the industry, while entities also may use fossil fuel energy on-site. The price of conventional grid electricity and volatility of fossil fuel prices may increase because of evolvingclimate change regulations and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other factors, while alternative energy sources become more cost-competitive. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply’s cost and reliability for operations. Since the industry operates on relatively narrow profit margins, reductions in energy consumption may have a significant influence on financial performance. The way an entity manages energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and their associated sustainability risks, and access alternative energy sources are likely to impact financial performance."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Tailings Storage Facilities Management,"The Metals & Mining industry faces significant operational hazards, particularly those associated with the structural integrity of tailings storage facilities (TSFs). A catastrophic failure of such facilities (e.g., a dam failure) can release significant volumes of waste streams and potentially harmful materials into the environment, leading to highconsequenceimpacts on ecosystems, human livelihood, local economies, and communities. Such catastrophic incidents may result in significant financial losses for entities and may erode their reputation and social license to operate. Robust approaches to tailings facilities design, management, operation, and closure, as well as appropriate management of associated risks, canhelp prevent such incidents from occurring. Entities that adopt comprehensive practices to maintain the integrity and safety of TSFs may do so through assigning accountability for tailings management at the highest levels of the entity, conducting frequent internal and external independent technical reviews of TSFs, and ensuring that mitigation measures are implemented in a timely manner in case of a safety concern. Additionally, a strong safety culture and well-established emergency preparedness and response plans can mitigate the impacts and financial implications of such events should they occur. Company obligations related to long-term remediation and compensation for damages may result in additional financial impacts in case of a failure. The ability for entities to meet such obligations after an incident occurs is an additional component of emergency preparedness."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Mining operations are energy-intensive and generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbondioxide from fuel use during mining, ore processing and smelting activities. The extent and type of GHG emissions can vary depending on the metal mined and processed. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to climate change- related risks may result in additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for metals and mining entities. Entities can achieve operational efficiencies through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial effect of increased fuel costs from regulations to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Water Management,"Mining and metals production can affect both the availability and the quality of local water resources. Metals and mining entities face operational, regulatory and reputational risks because of water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or the amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. Effects associated with water management may include higher costs, liabilities and lost revenues because of curtailment or suspension of operations. The severity of these risks may vary depending on the region’s water availability and the regulatory environment. Entities in the industry may deploy new technologies to manage risks related to water risk, including desalination, water recirculation and innovative waste-disposal solutions. Reducing water use and contamination can create operational efficiencies for entities and reduce their operating costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Business Ethics & Transparency,"Managing business ethics and maintaining an appropriate level of transparency in payments to governments or individuals are significant issues for the mining industry. This is due to the importance of government relations to entities’ ability to conduct business in this industry and to gain access to mining reserves. The emergence of several anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and payments-transparency laws and initiatives create regulatory mechanisms to reduce certain risks. Violations of these laws could lead to significant one-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs, whereas successful compliance with such regulations could provide risk mitigation opportunities and avoid adverse outcomes. Entities with significant reserves or operations in corruption-prone countries could face heightened risks. Entities are under pressure to ensure that their governance structures and business practices can address corruption and willful or unintentional participation in illegal or unethical payments or gifts to government officials or private persons."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Biodiversity Impacts,"The development, operation, closure, and remediation of mines can have a range of impacts on biodiversity, such as alterations of landscape, vegetation removal, and impacts to wildlife habitats. Acid rock drainage is a particularly significant risk: it is highly acidic water, rich in heavy metals, formed when surface and shallow subsurface water come into contact with mining overburden. Acid rock drainage can have harmful effects on humans, animals, and plants. Biodiversity impacts of mining operations can affect the valuation of reserves and create operational risks. The environmental characteristics of the land where reserves are located could increase extraction costs due to increasing interest in the protection of ecosystems. Entities could also face regulatory or reputational barriers to accessing reserves inecologically sensitive areas. This may include new protection status afforded to areas where reserves are located. Metals and mining entities face regulatory risks related to reclamation after a mine is decommissioned, per applicable regulatory requirements to restore mined property according to a prior, approved reclamation plan. Material costs may arise from removing or covering refuse piles, meeting water treatment obligations, and dismantling infrastructure at the end of life. Furthermore, ongoing mining operations are subject to laws protecting endangered species. Entities that have an effectiveenvironmental management plan for different stages of the project lifecycle may minimise their compliance costs and legal liabilities, face less resistance in developing new mines, and avoid difficulties in obtaining permits, accessing reserves,and facing delays in project completion."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Air Quality,"Non-greenhouse gas (GHG) air emissions from the Metals & Mining industry include hazardous air pollutants, criteria air pollutants, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from smelting and refining activities. These can have significant, localised human health and environmental impacts. Depending on the metal, uncaptured sulphur dioxide, lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic are among the chief pollutants, along with particulate matter. Financial impacts resulting from air emissions will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the applicable air emissions regulations. Active management of the issue—through technological and process improvements—could allow entities to limit the impacts ofincreasingly stringent air quality regulations globally. Entities could also benefit from operational efficiencies that could lead to a lower cost structure over time."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Energy Management,"Mining and metals production is often energy-intensive, with a significant proportion of energy consumption in the industry accounted for by purchased electricity. Although fuel combustion on-site contributes to the industry’s direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect, Scope 2 emissions. The energy intensityof operations may increase with decreasing grades of deposits and increasing depth and scale of mining operations. The choice between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity and the use of alternative energy can be important in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable and easily accessible energy is an important competitive factor in a commodity market driven by global competition, and purchased fuels and electricity can account for a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which an entity manages its overall energy efficiency and intensity, its reliance on different types of energy, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy, can therefore be a material factor."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Community Relations,"Mining facilities are frequently active over long periods of time, and entities may be involved in multiple projects in a region that can have a wide range of community impacts. Community rights and interests may be affected through environmental and social impacts of mining operations, such as competition for access to local energy or water resources,air and water emissions, and waste from operations. Mining entities rely upon support from local communities to be able to obtain permits and leases as well as to conduct their activities without disruptions. Entities may experience adverse financial impacts if the community interferes, or lobbies its government to interfere, with the rights of a mining entity in relation to their ability to access, develop, and produce reserves. In addition to community concerns about direct impacts of projects, the presence of mining activities may give rise to associated socio-economic concerns, such as education, health, livelihoods, and food security for the community. Metals and mining entities that are perceived as engaging in rent-seeking and exploiting a country or community’s resources without providing any socio-economic benefits in return may be exposed to the risk of actions, motivated by resource nationalism, and by host governments and communities. These could include imposition of ad hoc taxes and export restrictions. Entities in the extractives industries can adopt various community engagement strategies in their global operations to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests. Strategies are often underpinned by the integration of community engagement into phases of the project cycle. Entities are beginning to adopt a “shared value” approach to provide a key socio-economic benefit to the community while allowing the entity to profitably operate."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Workforce Health & Safety,"Safety is critical to mining operations due to the often hazardous working conditions. The Metals & Mining industry has relatively high fatality rates compared to other industries. Fatalities or injuries can result from a number of hazards associated with the industry, including powered haulage and machinery as well as mine integrity. Poor health and safety records can result in fines and penalties, and an increase in regulatory compliance costs from more stringent oversight. Anentity’s ability to protect employee health and safety, and to create a culture of safety and well-being among employees at all levels, can help prevent accidents, mitigate costs and operational downtime, and enhance workforce productivity."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Labour Relations,"Metals and mining entities face inherent tension between the need to lower the cost of labour to remain price competitive, and to manage human resources to ensure long-term performance. Working conditions related to metal andmining operations are usually physically demanding and hazardous. Labour unions play a key role in representing workers’interests and managing collective bargaining for better wages and working conditions. At the same time, metals and mining entities often operate in areas where worker rights are not adequately protected. The nuances of both domestic and international worker concerns make management of labour relations critical for metals and mining entities. Conflict with workers can result in labour strikes and other disruptions that can delay or stop production. Work stoppages frequently result in significant lost revenue and reputational damage. Continued labour stresses can impact the long-term profitability of the business. At the same time, positive outcomes of effective labour engagement can include enhanced work practices, labour utilisation, as well as the reduction in safety incidents, accidents, or fatalities."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,Waste & Hazardous Materials Management,"The Metals & Mining industry generates large volumes of non-mineral and mineral wastes, including waste rock, tailings, slurries, slags, sludges, smelting, and industrial wastes, some of which may contain substances that are toxic, hazardous, or chemically reactive. Mineral processing sometimes also requires the use of hazardous materials for metal extraction. Waste produced during mining operations, depending on its type, can be treated, disposed of, or stored in on- or off-site impoundments or old mine pits. Improper storage or disposal of hazardous materials used in operations or mining waste can present a significant long-term threat to human health and ecosystems through potential contamination of groundwater or surface water that is used for drinking or agriculture purposes. Entities that reduce waste streams while implementing policies to manage risks related to handling hazardous materials may emjoy lower regulatory and litigation risks, remediation liabilities, and costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Metals & Mining,"Security, Human Rights & Rights of Indigenous Peoples","Metals and mining entities face additional community-related risks when operating in conflict zones and in areas with weak or absent governance institutions, rule of law, and legislation to protect human rights. They also face risks when operating in areas with vulnerable communities, such as indigenous peoples. Entities using private or government securityforces to protect their workers and assets may knowingly, or unknowingly, contribute to human rights violations, including use of excessive force. Indigenous people are often the most vulnerable sections of the population, with limited capacity to defend their unique rights and interests. Entities perceived as contributing to human rights violations or failingto account for indigenous peoples’ rights may be affected due to protests, riots, or suspension of permits. They could facesubstantial costs related to compensation or settlement payments, and write-downs in the value of their reserves in such areas. In the absence of country laws to address such cases, several international instruments have emerged to provide guidelines for entities. These instruments include obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for decisions affecting them. With greater awareness, several countries are also beginning to implement specific laws protecting indigenous peoples’ rights, creating increasing regulatory risk for entities."
Financials,Investment Banking & Brokerage,Employee Diversity & Inclusion,"Investment banking and brokerage entities face a high degree of competition for skilled employees. At the same time, theindustry has a low level of diversity, especially among senior roles. In recent years, considerable media attention has been focused on cases of gender discrimination involving publicly listed entities in the industry. As the industry continues to undergo rapid innovation through the introduction of more complex financial products and computerised algorithmic andhigh-frequency trading, the ability of entities to attract and retain skilled employees will likely become increasingly material. By ensuring gender and racial diversity throughout the organisation, entities are likely to expand their candidate pool, which could lower hiring cost and improve operational efficiency. Further, evidence suggests that diverse groups of employees at investment banking and brokerage entities may reduce risk taking for employees involved in risk-prone trading activities (e.g., trading), which could lower risk exposure of the firm as a whole. Enhanced disclosure regarding employee gender and racial/ethnic diversity, especially when provided by employee category, will allow shareholders to assess how entities in this industry are managing these risks and opportunities. "
Financials,Investment Banking & Brokerage,Professional Integrity,"The business model of investment banking and brokerage entities is dependent on the development of client trust and loyalty. To ensure long-term, mutually beneficial relationships, entities need to provide services that satisfy the highest professional standards of the industry, which means taking measures to avoid conflicts of interest, misrepresentation, and negligence. Professional integrity also pertains to following a code of ethics with respect to transparency and disclosure. These measures are important both for strengthening an entity’s license to operate as well as for attracting and retaining clients. Failure to comply with professional standards can harm not only the clients who rely on the advice, data, and key services these entities provide, but it may also negatively affect shareholders. Investment banking and brokerage entities could not only face legal penalties related to such actions, but also incur significant negative impacts on revenue from reputational damage. To maintain professional integrity, investment banking and brokerage entities need to ensure that employees have adequate training as well as know and adhere to applicable financial industry regulations. To comply withindustry laws and regulations, employers need to ensure that they are aware of any past record of violation of employees who are involved in communications and providing advice to clients. Therefore, a description of management’s approach to assuring professional integrity can help investors understand risk exposure as well as any processes in place to avoid misconduct. Additionally, disclosure of the entity’s amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements can provide a clearer picture of the extent to which financial institutions are adhering to regulatory norms."
Financials,Investment Banking & Brokerage,Factors in Investment Banking & Brokerage Activities,"Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors may have material impacts on the entities assets and projects across arange of industries to which investment banks provide services or in which they invest. Therefore, by accounting for thesefactors in underwriting, advisory, investing and lending activities, investment banks may manage significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities effectively. The potential for both value creation and loss associated with ESG factors suggests that investment banking and brokerage entities have a responsibility to shareholders and clients to consider these factors when analysing and valuing core products, including sell-side research, advisory services, origination, underwriting and principal transactions. Investment banking and brokerage entities that fail to manage these risks and opportunities effectively may expose themselves to increased reputational and financial risks. Appropriately pricing ESG risks may reduce investment banks’ financial risk exposure, help generate additional revenue or open new market opportunities. To help investors better understand how entities in the industry manage these issues, investment banks should disclose how they incorporate ESG factors in their core products and services."
Financials,Investment Banking & Brokerage,Business Ethics,"The regulatory environment surrounding investment banking and brokerage entities continues to evolve both nationally and internationally. Entities are required to adhere to a complex and often inconsistent set of rules relating to performance and conduct as well as provide disclosure on issues including insider trading, anti-trust, price fixing, and market manipulation. In addition, investment banking and brokerage entities are subject to rules against tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and corrupt practices. Finally, in some jurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistleblowers may lead to an increase in the number of complaints brought to regulators. Firms that are able to ensure regulatory compliance through robust internal controls will be better positioned to build trust with clients, leading to increased revenue, and to protect shareholder value by minimising losses incurred as a result of legal proceedings."
Financials,Investment Banking & Brokerage,Systemic Risk Management,"The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the importance of managing risks to capital in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry. Specifically, firms that failed to manage these risks suffered significant losses to the value of their financial assets while increasing the amount of liabilities held on the books, which, due to the interconnectedness of the financial system, contributed to a significant market disruption. The systemic nature of risk resulting from the interconnectedness of financial institutions has become a central concern of federal and international regulators. As a result, many banks are required to undergo supervisory stress tests to evaluate whether the entity has the capital and liquidity to absorb losses, continue operations, and meet obligations in the event of adverse economic and financial conditions. Their failure to meet regulatory requirements could substantially raise future compliance cost as well as lead tomonetary penalties. In an effort to demonstrate how these risks associated with banks’ size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability, and cross-jurisdictional activity are being managed, investment banks should enhancedisclosure on quantitative and qualitative metrics measuring how well they are positioned to absorb shocks arising from systemic financial and economic stress and meet stricter regulatory requirements."
Financials,Investment Banking & Brokerage,Employee Incentives & Risk Taking,"Employee compensation structures in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry can incentivize employees to focus onshort-term or long-term entity performance. Structures that have excessive focus on the short-term performance are likelyto encourage excessive risk-taking and present adverse implications for long-term corporate value. Concern over this issuehas led to increased regulatory and shareholder scrutiny since the 2008 financial crisis. Improved disclosure of employee compensation, focusing on the use of performance metrics and variable remuneration, policies around clawback provisions, supervision, control, and validation of traders' pricing of Level 3 assets will provide investors with a clear understanding of how investment banking entities are protecting corporate value."
Consumer Goods,Toys & Sporting Goods,Chemical & Safety Hazards of Products,"Consumers and regulators expect the Toys & Sporting Goods industry to ensure that its products are safe and do not cause harm. The presence of certain chemicals in products—which can be introduced by design or as a result of poor oversight over supply chains—can have chronic impacts on child development and health. Faulty or poorly designed products can also create choking, fire, or other hazards, which can result in injury or death. The Toys & Sporting Goods industry is subject to regulation over the safety of its products. The toys segment in particular is highly regulated to protect children, and evolving science on the safety of certain chemicals will likely lead to additional restrictions. Failure to create products that are safe for consumers may provoke new regulatory oversight and affect an entity’s social license to operate. Furthermore, improper product safety testing or evaluation can lead to costly recalls, litigation, or reputational damage that can affect sales. Toys and sporting goods entities that work at both the design and manufacturing phases tomanage the use of certain chemicals while eliminating others can better mitigate risks associated with chemical safety."
Consumer Goods,Toys & Sporting Goods,Labour Conditions in the Supply Chain,"The treatment of workers and labour conditions in the industry’s manufacturing supply chain are of growing concern for consumers, regulators, and entities. Labour issues include worker health and safety standards, compensation, amount of working hours, and risks related to discrimination and forced labour. The industry is exposed to these issues because of itsreliance on third-party manufacturing in emerging markets, where labour standards, labour protection, and regulation enforcement can be weak, and violations are common. Entities also contract with numerous suppliers, adding complexity and challenges with respect to transparency. A failure to manage labour conditions can result in supply disruptions, reputational damage, and increased regulation and enforcement in response to high-profile safety or labour incidents, strikes and work stoppages, and shifts in consumer demand. Toys and sporting goods entities are increasingly engaging with suppliers through audits, partnerships, and increased oversight, allowing them to preempt and react more quickly to labour issues. Entities that effectively manage this issue can protect brand value and reduce their cost of capital."
Services,Hotels & Lodging,Water Management,"Hotel buildings require a relatively large amount of water resources to operate. Although water is not the industry’s greatest operating cost, reduced water availability or significant price increases could affect financial results. This effect may be particularly acute in water-stressed regions because of supply constraints. Entities in the industry are implementing water management best practices to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and to improve their brand value with guests, who increasingly are concerned about environmental sustainability."
Services,Hotels & Lodging,Climate Change Adaptation,"Hotels operating in climate change-exposed areas may be impacted by physical climate risks including inclement weather and flooding. Inclement weather may damage property and disrupt operations, thereby reducing asset values and revenues. In addition, hotels may face higher insurance premiums for buildings located in coastal regions or may be unable to insure their properties. Hotel operators will likely need to adapt to shifting climate trends such as rising sea levels, hurricanes, and flooding in order to maintain their climate-exposed revenue-generating properties."
Services,Hotels & Lodging,Energy Management,"Hotel buildings require a significant amount of energy to operate, which is a substantial portion of hotel operating expenses. The industry purchases the majority of its electricity commercially. This purchased electricity indirectly results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is a significant contributor to climate change. Entities in the industry are implementing energy management best practices to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and to improve their brand value with guests, who increasingly are concerned about environmental sustainability."
Services,Hotels & Lodging,Ecological Impacts,"Healthy ecosystems are linked with the economic and financial performance of local communities and businesses. The influx of tourists and the waste generated by hotels can present risks to sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs and nature preserves. Poor environmental protection practices may preclude hotels from obtaining new construction licenses in these sensitive areas and could, in the long term, diminish natural attractions for tourists that help to generate revenue for communities and hotels. In contrast, protection of the environment may make travel destinations more attractive and increase demand for room bookings."
Services,Hotels & Lodging,Labour Practices,"The Hotels & Lodging industry is highly reliant on labour to operate large facilities. A service-oriented workforce that is able to provide guests a pleasant stay is a key value driver for hotel entities. This, combined with labour force dynamics, can lead to low job satisfaction that can result in high turnover and potential lawsuits, which contribute to increased expenses for hotel operators. Hotels that work to prevent discriminatory practices and ensure fair wages can improve worker satisfaction and reduce turnover."
Food & Beverage,"Meat, Poultry & Dairy",Land Use & Ecological Impacts,"Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry operations have diverse ecological impacts, primarily because of significant land-use requirements to raise livestock and the contamination of the air, land and groundwater by animal waste. While the impacts are varied, both traditional and confined animal feeding operations may result in significant ecological impacts. The primary concern from confined animal feeding operations and animal-product processing facilities is the generation of large and concentrated amounts of waste and pollutants. Treating effluent and waste from facilities involves significantcosts. Non-confined animal feeding operations require large tracts of pastureland and may result in the physical degradation of land resources. Land use and ecological impacts pose legal and regulatory risks in the form of fines, litigation and difficulties obtaining permits for facility expansions or waste discharges."
Food & Beverage,"Meat, Poultry & Dairy",Antibiotic Use in Animal Production,"The use of antibiotics in livestock production is of increasing concern due to the potential impacts on public health. Prevalent use of antibiotics in livestock production that are also administered to humans may promote the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. While the use of antibiotics in animal feed or water supplies can improve the output of animal production and enhance animal welfare in industrial farm settings, entities in the industry must balance these benefits with the potential for negative public health risks. The use of antibiotics in animal production presents reputational and regulatory risks, both of which can affect long-term profitability through impacts on demand and marketshare for meat, poultry, and dairy producers. Depending on the animal species, entities in the industry have differing levels of control over and management approaches to this issue, from having direct control over the feed and medicine administered by contract suppliers to more broadly setting requirements for suppliers. "
Food & Beverage,"Meat, Poultry & Dairy",Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry generates significant Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both livestock andenergy-intensive industrial processes. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for meat, poultry and dairy entities because of climate change mitigation policies. The majorityof the industry’s emissions stem directly from the animals themselves through the release of methane during enteric fermentation, and from manure storage and processing. The direct emissions from raising and producing livestock represent a significant portion of total GHG emissions released among all sources. Currently, these emissions sources are not regulated widely, which presents uncertainties regarding the future of GHG regulations for the industry. Entities in thisindustry also use large quantities of fossil fuels to meet energy needs, generating additional direct GHG emissions and increasing exposure to regulatory risks. Future emission regulations could result in additional operating or compliance costs. By implementing new technologies to capture animal emissions and focusing on energy efficiency, entities may mitigate regulatory risk and volatile energy costs while also limiting GHG emissions."

"
Services,Advertising & Marketing,Advertising Integrity,"Entities have a legal responsibility to ensure that advertising about their products and services is truthful and not deceptive. While much of the burden of compliance with regulations about ad content and placement lies with the client,ad agencies play a vital role in the creation of ad content and are responsible for advising their clients regarding applicableregulations. Consumer protection laws provide guidance and restrictions on advertising to children and on advertising regulated products, such as alcohol and tobacco. Regulators may investigate the involvement of the ad agency in any deceptive advertising and take action against the agency. Advertising and marketing entities exposed to these regulations and concerns have responded by participating in self-regulatory programs that address these areas."
Services,Advertising & Marketing,Data Privacy,"Due to the increasing prevalence of social media, location-based mobile applications, and e-commerce, the digital footprints of customers offer a more complete picture of their habits than was previously available to advertisers. Advertisers can collect and/or purchase highly detailed information about the habits and lives of buyers, and advertising strategies can be precisely targeted. Being part of an industry that uses large quantities of data about private citizens, advertising and marketing entities must weigh the benefits of targeted advertising versus customer concerns about data privacy."
Services,Advertising & Marketing,Workforce Diversity & Inclusion,"Competitive advantage in the Advertising & Marketing industry is derived from an entity’s ability to produce creative, cutting-edge ideas. Entities in this industry aim to attract top talent to create the most successful ad campaigns. Additionally, larger entities have clients across the globe, and must employ a diverse workforce to effectively reach diverseaudiences. Connecting with a target markets has been shown to rely, to a large extent, upon employing a workforce that is reflective of the community served. A diverse workforce is thus a critical success factor to improving service outcomes and enhancing an entity's financial performance."
Transportation,Road Transportation,Driver Working Conditions,"The Road Transportation industry faces challenges with driver recruitment and retention. A growing labour shortage, due in part to the challenging working conditions in the industry as well as to regulations that limit working hours, may raise labour costs and lower industry revenue. Time-critical deliveries are demanding for drivers, who may experience long and often odd hours behind the wheel, lengthy stays away from home, lack of sleep, and feelings of isolation. These factors, in combination with high injury and illness rates, largely due to accidents, make it difficult to recruit new drivers and to retain existing staff. Entities that offer better driver working conditions may benefit from lower turnover rates, higher productivity, and the ability to hire staff to expand operations and increase revenue."
Transportation,Road Transportation,Air Quality,"Compared to other modes of transport, road freight has a more localised negative effect on air quality through its emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Heavy reliance on diesel fuel is of particular concern; although diesel engines realise better gas mileage than gasoline engines, they generate more harmful air pollutants. Using alternative fuels and filtering emissions prior to release can help entities comply with air quality regulations and avoid contributing to smog in cities and dense population centres, which may damage their social license to operate."
Transportation,Road Transportation,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The Road Transportation industry generates emissions mainly through the combustion of diesel and other fossil fuels in truck engines. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO2) are of particular importance to government regulators concerned about climate change and to consumers demanding low-carbon or carbon-neutral transportation solutions. Because GHG emissions from trucks constitute a significant portion of transportation-related emissions, the industry is a focal point for regulations to limit GHG emissions. Operational changes that increase fuel efficiency may reduce fuel costs while also limiting exposure to volatile fuel pricing, regulatory costs and other consequences of GHG emissions. Although newer trucks are more fuel-efficient, other measures also may improve efficiency and reduce emissions in existing fleets."

Amusement park rides, ski slopes, and other facilities may expose employees to potentially unsafe conditions that result in injury or even death. Potential financial impacts associated with employee safety violations include regulatory fines, abatement costs, and negative impacts on brand reputation. These impacts may stem from accidents as well as from chronic safety issues. "
Services,Leisure Facilities,Energy Management,"Leisure facilities entities operate large outdoor and indoor facilities that may consume a significant amount of energy. Most of the industry’s electricity is purchased commercially, which indirectly results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a significant contributor to climate change. Entities in the industry are implementing energy management best practices to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and to improve their brand value with guests, who increasingly areconcerned about environmental sustainability."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Pricing Integrity & Transparency,"The construction materials market has been subject to instances of anti-competitive behaviour, such as maintaining artificially high prices through cartel activity. Most countries have well-established fair business practice laws in place to prevent such behaviours. Business activity leading to price fixing or other manipulation of prices can lead to material legal fines or business disruption. Managing anti-competitive behaviour within an organisation can effectively mitigate regulatory risks, including those related to investigations of mergers and acquisitions or compliance costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The production of construction materials, particularly cement, generates significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from on-site fuel combustion and chemical processes. The industry has achieved efficiency gains in reducing emissions per ton of materials produced. At the same time, increasing production is associated with increasing absolute emissions from cement production. The production of construction materials remains carbon-intensive relative to other industries, exposing the industry to higher operating and capital expenditures from emissions regulations. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions include energy efficiency, use of alternative and renewable fuels, carbon sequestration and clinker substitution. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs as well as direct emissions from regulations that limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Water Management,"Construction materials production requires substantial volumes of water. Entities face operational, regulatory and reputational risks associated with water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. Risks are likely to be higher in regions of water scarcity because of potential water availability constraints and price volatility. Entities unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase productioncosts. Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower operating risks and costs for entities by minimising the impact of regulations, water supply shortages and community-related disruptions on entity operations."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Product Innovation,"Innovations in building materials are an essential component in the growth of sustainable construction. Consumer and regulatory trends are driving adoption of sustainable building materials and processes that are more resource efficient andcan reduce health impacts of buildings throughout their lifecycle. This is creating new business drivers for construction materials entities, with an opportunity to increase revenue.

Therefore, sustainable construction materials can contribute to an entity’s long-term growth and competitiveness."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Biodiversity Impacts,"Construction materials entities often operate their own quarries close to processing facilities. Quarrying requires the removal of vegetation and topsoil. It also requires the blasting and crushing of underlying stone deposits. The process can lead to permanent alterations of the landscape, with associated impacts on biodiversity. The environmental characteristics of the land where quarrying takes place could increase extraction costs, due to increasing awareness and protection of ecosystems. Entities could also face regulatory or reputational barriers to accessing sites in ecologically sensitive areas. Thismay include new protection status afforded to areas where reserves are located. Ongoing quarrying operations may also be subject to laws protecting endangered species. Entities that have an effective environmental management plan for different stages of the project lifecycle—including restoration during site decommissioning—could minimise their compliance costs and legal liabilities. These entities could face less community resistance in quarrying at new sites and avoid difficulties in obtaining permits and delays in project completion."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Air Quality,"On-site fuel combustion and production processes in the Construction Materials industry emit criteria air pollutants and hazardous chemicals, including small quantities of organic compounds and heavy metals. Emissions of particular concern include nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides, particulate matter, heavy metals (for example, mercury), dioxins and volatile organic compounds, among others. These air emissions can have significant, localised human health and environmental impacts. Financial impacts resulting from air emissions will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the applicable air emissions regulations, but they could include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Active management of the issue—through technological and process improvements—may allow entities to limit the impact of regulations and benefit from operational efficiencies that could lead to a lower cost structure over time."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Energy Management,"The production of construction materials requires significant energy, sourced primarily from direct fossil fuel combustion as well as from purchased electricity. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change, and electricity purchases from the grid can create indirect Scope 2 emissions. Construction materials entities also use alternative fuels forkilns, such as scrap tyres and waste oil—often waste generated by other industries. If properly managed, these can lower energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, potentially negative impacts could occur, such as releases of harmful air pollutants that entities need to minimise to obtain net benefits from using such fuels. Decisions about use of alternative fuels, renewable energy and on-site generation of electricity (versus purchases from the grid) can be importantin influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with purchased fuels and electricity accounting for a significant proportion of total production costs. How a construction materials entity manages energy efficiency, reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and access to alternative sources of energy may influence its profitability."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Workforce Health & Safety,"Employees and contractors of construction materials entities face significant health and safety risks. Industry hazards include those arising from the use of heavy equipment and from quarrying operations. In addition to acute impacts, workers can develop chronic health conditions from silica dust inhalation, among other factors. Due to these hazards, theindustry has relatively high fatality rates, and many entities have implemented a strong safety culture and health and safety policies to mitigate associated risks. Worker injuries, illnesses, and fatalities can lead to regulatory penalties, negative publicity, low worker morale and productivity, and increased healthcare and compensation costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Construction Materials,Waste Management,"Construction materials production recycling rates are high. However, waste from production processes, pollution control devices and from hazardous waste management activities present a regulatory risk and can increase operating costs. Cement kiln dust (CKD)—consisting of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline waste removed from cement kiln exhaust gas byair pollution control devices—is the most significant waste category in the industry. Regulatory risk remains high from evolving environmental laws. Entities that reduce waste streams—hazardous waste streams in particular—and recycle by-products, can reduce regulatory and litigation risks and costs."
Food & Beverage,Tobacco,Marketing Practices,"Tobacco product labelling and marketing is heavily regulated internationally. The World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has led many countries to introduce new, stricter regulatory approaches to prevent people from adopting tobacco use at a young age through transparent advertising about tobacco’s health risks. The industry has faced costly legal battles related to the marketing and advertising of its products. Marketing for combustible and new non-combustible products have to balance regulatory requirements with the need to reach new markets. Failing to properly manage social externalities may lead to further unfavourable regulation and erode the industry’s social license to operate. Entities that effectively manage this issue can reduce the likelihood of extraordinary expenses, improve marketshare, and decrease liabilities."
Food & Beverage,Tobacco,Public Health,"Tobacco use can lead to serious health risks as established by many scientific studies over the past several decades. Healthproblems associated with tobacco include lung disease, cancer, and heart disease. Tobacco product manufacturers have faced lawsuits from individuals, governments, corporations, and other groups. In some cases, these have resulted in multibillion-dollar settlements. A growing public awareness of the associated health risks has driven down tobacco use dramatically in many countries. Tobacco product manufacturers are introducing an array of “harm reduction” products, such as non-tobacco nicotine products and heated tobacco products, aimed at minimising the health impacts of tobacco use while accessing new markets. Future scientific studies could reach new conclusions on these assertions of reduced harm, with continuing impacts on entity revenue and growth potential. "
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Pricing Integrity & Transparency,"Regulators such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)are responsible for overseeing issues related to pricing integrity and transparency, which includes the potential for market manipulation by oil and gas entities, including Refining & Marketing (R&M) entities. Regulatory agencies focusing on refineries may investigate various competitive factors, including utilisation and maintenance decisions, product supply decisions, product margins, and capital planning, creating uncertainty regarding future enforcement. The focus of enforcement actions also includes reporting prices to price index publishers, as well as potential price distortions through trading positions in physical transactions, and swaps, futures, and derivatives. Maintaining market integrity and ensuring transparency in product pricing can therefore lower regulatory risks and liabilities for R&M entities and protect consumers from unfair pricing."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Oil and Gas R&M operations generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a variety of sources. Emissions primarily consist of carbon dioxide and methane from stationary fossil fuel combustion for energy supply. Energy costs are a significant share of refinery operating costs. GHGs also are released from process emissions, fugitive emissions resulting from leaks, emissions from venting and flaring, and from non-routine events such as equipment maintenance. The energy intensity of production, and therefore the GHG emissions intensity, can vary significantly depending on the type of crude oil feedstock used and refined product specifications. Entities that cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions from their operations may capture operational efficiencies. Such reductions also may mitigate the effects of increased fuel costs from regulations that limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Water Management,"Refineries can use large quantities of water depending on their size and refining process complexity. This water use exposes them to the risk of water scarcity, depending on their location, and related costs. Extraction of water from water-stressed regions or water contamination also may create tensions with local communities. Refinery operations require wastewater treatment and disposal, often via on-site wastewater treatment plants before discharge. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling and other water management strategies may permit entities to capture operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs. They also could minimise regulatory, water supply shortages and community-related disruptions on operations."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment,"The Oil & Gas – Refining & Marketing industry is subject to numerous sustainability-related regulations and an often rapidly changing regulatory environment. Changes to the legal and regulatory environment may result in material impactson shareholder value. Entities in the industry regularly participate in the regulatory and legislative process on a wide variety of environmental and societal issues. Such engagement can result from entities seeking to ensure industry views are represented in the development of regulations impacting the industry as well as to represent shareholder interests. At the same time, such engagement to influence environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect entities’ reputations and ultimately impact an entity’s social license to operate. "
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Air Quality,"Non-greenhouse gas (GHG) air emissions from Refining & Marketing (R&M) operations include criteria air pollutants, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants, which can have significant, localised human health and environmental impacts. Specific emissions of concern include sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen sulphide, particulate matter, and VOCs. Releases occur from stationary combustion sources, storage vessels, flares, and equipment leaks, and may also occur as a result of accidents. Human health impacts and financial consequences for R&M entities arelikely to be exacerbated the closer a facility is to population centres. Active management of the issue—through technological and process improvements—can allow entities to limit the impact of regulations and benefit from operational efficiencies that could lead to a lower cost structure over time."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Workforce Health & Safety,"Hazards associated with the operations of entities in the Refining & Marketing (R&M) industry may present risks to employee health and safety. Such hazards include the handling and processing of hydrocarbons, frequently at high temperatures and pressures during refining operations. Accidents or inadvertent exposures to chemicals and other hazards such as heat or noise may result in fatalities, severe injuries, or illnesses. Releases of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances as a result of accidents or leaks can also have negative consequences for neighbouring communities. An entity’s ability to protect employee health and safety, and to create a culture of safety and well-being among employees at all levels, can help prevent accidents, mitigate costs and operational downtime, and enhance workforce productivity."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Hazardous Materials Management,"As a byproduct of their operations, Refining & Marketing (R&M) entities generate various forms of waste derived from theprocessing and storage of petroleum products. Many of these substances are hazardous to human health and the environment and may be subject to regulation. Remediation of inactive or decommissioned sites often takes several years to be completed, and entities may accrue liabilities for past operations. Releases of hazardous substances from underground storage tanks (USTs) used by refining facilities and gas stations can affect redevelopment of land for abandoned or closed facilities. Spills and releases during operations can lead to groundwater contamination and other negative impacts. R&M entities that reduce and recycle hazardous waste streams ensure the integrity of their USTs, as wellas those that have effective and prompt clean-up and remediation measures in place for normal operations and decommissioned facilities, may enjoy reduced regulatory and litigation risks and associated costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Product Specifications & Clean Fuel Blends,"Some regulatory jurisdictions have implemented product specifications and renewable fuel blends, which pose significant compliance and operational risks for Refining & Marketing entities. Entities may face long-term reductions in revenue from fossil fuel-based products and services because of GHG mitigation policies such as renewable fuel mandates or standards, as well as competition from non-fossil fuel products. To ensure regulatory compliance and position themselves for long-term competitiveness, some entities are investing in clean fuel production or purchasing ethanol and other renewable biofuels. Advanced biofuels and fuel technologies have lower lifecycle impacts than traditional biofuels, and they can be used to minimise future regulatory risks and public pressure. Although short-term costs to find commercially viable technologies can be significant, investments in R&D for such technologies could serve to support R&M entities’ long-term profitability."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing,Critical Incident Risk Management,"The operations of Refining & Marketing entities are often characterised by a high number of hazards, including the handling of flammable, volatile substances, the use of highly reactive chemicals, and the processing of fluids at high temperature and pressure. Releases of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances as a result of accidents can have significant consequences for an entity’s workforce, as well as external social and environmental consequences. In addition to effective process safety management practices, entities frequently prioritise developing a culture of safety to reduce theprobability that accidents and other health and safety incidents will occur. If accidents and other emergencies do occur, entities with a strong safety culture are often able to more effectively detect and respond to such incidents. A culture thatengages and empowers employees and contractors to work with management to safeguard their own health, safety, andwell-being and prevent accidents is likely to help entities reduce production downtime, mitigate costs, ensure workforce productivity, and maintain their license to operate."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Iron and steel production generates significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, from production processes and on-site fuel combustion. Although technological improvements have reduced the GHG emissions per ton of steel produced, steel production remains carbon-intensive compared to other industries. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result in additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for iron and steel entities because of climate change mitigation policies. Entities can achieve operational efficiencies through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Capturing such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial effects of increased fuel costs from regulations that limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Water Management,"Steel production requires substantial volumes of water. Entities face increasing operational, regulatory and reputational risks associated with water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. These risks are particularly likely to affect regions where water is scarce, resulting in water availability constraints and price volatility. Entities unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs. Consequently, entities adopting technologies and processes to decrease reduce water consumption may reduce operatingrisks and costs by mitigating the operational impacts of regulatory changes, water supply shortages and community-related disruptions."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Supply Chain Management,"Iron ore and coal are critical raw material inputs to the steel production process. Iron ore mining and coal production are resource-intensive processes. Mineral extraction often has substantial environmental and social impacts adversely affectinglocal communities, workers and ecosystems. Community protests, legal or regulatory action, or increased regulatory compliance costs or penalties can disrupt mining operations. Iron and steel entities could face supply disruptions as a result, or in some cases, also may be subject to regulatory penalties associated with the environmental or social impact of the mining entity supplier. Minimising such risks through appropriate supplier screening, monitoring and engagement, iron and steel producers may manage their direct critical raw materials suppliers proactively to ensure they are not engaged in illegal or otherwise environmentally or socially damaging practices."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Air Emissions,"Iron and steel production typically generates criteria air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants, which can have significant localised public health impacts. Of particular concern are sulphur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, lead, carbon monoxide, and manganese, as well as particles such as soot and dust, which are released during theproduction process. Across North America, Western Europe, and Japan, technological innovation and continuous improvements in steel-making processes have significantly reduced air pollutants from the Iron & Steel Producers industry. However, air pollutants remain a concern due to heightened regulatory and public concern about air pollution, as well as expansion of steel production in emerging markets. Iron and steel production in emerging markets may be impacted by regulatory efforts aimed at curbing air pollution. Active management of facility emissions through implementation of industry best practices across global operations can facilitate the transition to sustainable steel production, lowering costs and potentially enhancing operational efficiency."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Energy Management,"The production of steel requires significant energy, sourced primarily from the direct fossil fuel combustion as well as energy purchased from the grid. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change, and electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect Scope 2 emissions. The choice between various production processes—electric arc furnaces and integrated basic oxygen furnaces—can influence whether an entity uses fossil fuels or purchases electricity. This decision, together with the choice between using coal versus natural gas or on-site versus grid-sourced electricity, may influence both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible and reliable energy is an important industry competitive factor. Energy costs account for a substantial portion of iron and steel manufacturing costs. How an iron and steel entity manages its energy efficiency, its reliance on various types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Workforce Health & Safety,"Industrial processes used in iron and steel production can present significant risks to employees and contractors working at iron and steel plants. Given the high temperatures and heavy machinery involved, worker injuries and fatalities are a matter of concern to iron and steel producers. The industry has relatively high fatality rates, signifying the hazardous workenvironment and requiring a strong safety culture and health and safety policies. While accident rates in the industry are on a long-term decline, worker injuries and fatalities can lead to regulatory penalties, negative publicity, low worker morale and productivity, and increased healthcare and compensation costs."
Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,Waste Management,"While waste reclamation rates in steel production are high, the industry generates significant quantities of hazardous wastes. There are three main waste types in the industry—slag, dusts, and sludges. These by-products are often recycled internally or sold to other industries. However, process wastes such as electric arc furnace dust, which is regulated as a hazardous material in the U.S. due to its heavy metal content, can have significant environmental and human health impacts, present a regulatory risk, and result in additional operating costs for entities. Risks related to the long-term impacts of waste disposal may result in significant costs, including those associated with contaminated off-site disposal properties, for which iron and steel producers may be held responsible for remediation and restoration activities. Entities that reduce waste streams and hazardous waste streams in particular, and recycle or sell non-hazardous by-products, could therefore lower regulatory risks and costs while increasing revenues."
Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,Climate Impacts of Business Mix,"Engineering & Construction Services industry clients may be exposed to potentially disruptive climate regulation as well as those that mitigate climate change. Some types of construction projects are significant climate change contributors because of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted during their use phase. Projects that may contribute to global GHG emissions include those in extractive industries, as well as large buildings. Whereas some infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy projects, are designed to reduce GHG emissions, many types of projects present trade-offs. Mass transitsystems, for example, may contribute to GHG emissions while reducing net emissions once the benefits offered by the system are factored. Several entities in the industry generate a substantial share of revenue and profits from clients in carbon-intensive industries and whose future capital investments may be at risk because of evolving climate regulations. Downside risks may manifest through project delays, cancellations and diminished long-term revenue growth opportunities. On the other hand, entities that specialise in infrastructure projects that contribute to GHG mitigation could develop competitive advantages as they continue to focus on these growing markets. As the industry and its customers continue to operate within an uncertain business environment and face increasing environmental and regulatory requirements, assessing and communicating the risks and opportunities stemming from climate change that are embedded in an entity’s backlog and future business prospects may help investors in assessing the overall business impact of climate change."
Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,Workforce Health & Safety,"Construction, maintenance and repair services, and other on-site activities require a substantial amount of manual labour. Fatality and injury rates in the Engineering & Construction Services industry are high compared with those in other industries as a result of the workforce’s exposure to powered haulage and heavy machinery accidents, fall accidents, exposure to hazardous chemicals, and other unique and potentially dangerous situations. Additionally, temporary workersmay be at a higher risk due to lack of training or industry experience. Failing to protect worker health and safety can result in fines and penalties; serious incidents can lead to acute, one-time extraordinary expenses and contingent liabilitiesfrom legal and/or regulatory actions. In addition, health and safety incidents can result in project delays and downtime that raise project costs and lower profitability. Entities that seek to properly train both permanent and temporary employees and build a strong safety culture could reduce their risk profile while potentially gaining a competitive advantage in new project bids and proposals as a result of strong workforce health and safety track records."
Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,Business Ethics,"Entities in the industry face risks associated with bribery, corruption, and anti-competitive practices. This is due to several factors, including the global operations of many entities, the need to manage multiple local agents and subcontractors, the complexity of project financing and project permitting, the magnitude of the contracts involved in building large infrastructure projects, and the competitive process necessary to secure contracts with private and public entities. Ethical breaches can result in investigations by authorities, as well as large fines, settlement costs, and damaged reputations. Such breaches may include violations of anti-bribery laws, such as paying government officials in order to gain project contracts. They may also include unethical bidding practices, such as complementary bidding (e.g., submitting an artificially high or otherwise unacceptable bid for a contract that a bidder does not intend to win) and bid-pooling (e.g., coordinating to split contracts and assure each bidder is awarded a certain amount of work). Moreover, entities with poortrack records can be barred from working on future projects, resulting in lost revenue. Developing an ethical culture through employee training, effective governance structures, and internal controls is critical for entities to mitigate risks associated with business ethics."
Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,Lifecycle Impacts of Buildings & Infrastructure,"Buildings and major infrastructure projects are among the largest users of natural resources in the economy; during construction, these materials include iron and steel products, cement, concrete, bricks, drywall, wallboards, glass, insulation, fixtures, doors, and cabinetry, among others. Once completed, and during their daily use, these projects often consume significant amounts of resources in the form of energy and water (for a discussion on direct environmental impacts from project construction see the Environmental Impacts of Project Development topic). Therefore, the sourcing of construction materials and the everyday use of buildings and infrastructure may contribute to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global or local resource constraints, water stress and negative human health outcomes. Client and regulatory pressures to develop a sustainable built environment are contributing to the growth of markets intended to reduce the lifecycle impacts of buildings and infrastructure projects. In response, various international sustainable building and infrastructure certification schemes assess, among other aspects, a project’s use-phase energy and water efficiency, impacts on human health, and the use of sustainable construction and building materials. As a result, various opportunities are being created for industries in the value chain—from suppliers that can provide such materials, to entities in the Engineering & Construction Services industry that can provide sustainability-oriented project design, consulting and construction services. Such services can provide a competitive advantage and revenue growth opportunities as client demand for economically advantageous sustainable projects increases and related regulations evolve. Entities unable to effectively integrate such considerations into their services may lose market share in the long term."
Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,Environmental Impacts of Project Development,"Infrastructure construction projects improve economic and social development; however, they also may pose risks to the local environment and surrounding communities. Industry activities can disrupt local ecosystems through biodiversity impacts, air emissions, water discharges, natural resource consumption, waste generation and hazardous chemicals use. Construction entities perform clearing, grading and excavation activities and may generate harmful waste during project construction. Effectively assessing environmental impacts before construction may mitigate unforeseen issues that may increase operational expenses and capital costs. In some cases, environmental concerns or local community pushback mayresult in project delays and, in extreme cases, project cancellations, which may affect an entity’s profitability and growth opportunities. Failure to comply with environmental regulations during construction may result in costly fines and remediation costs, and it can damage an entity’s reputation. Environmental impact assessments can provide an understanding of a project’s potential environmental impacts and necessary mitigation activities before it begins. Likewise,proper management of environmental risks during project construction may reduce regulatory oversight or community pushback. By assessing environmental considerations before project initiation, as well as continuing to evaluate them during project development, engineering and construction entities may be prepared to mitigate potential environmental issues and the associated financial risks that may occur, while also establishing a competitive advantage for obtaining newcontracts with prospective clients."
Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,Structural Integrity & Safety,"Whether providing engineering, design, architectural, consulting, inspection, construction or maintenance services, entities in this industry have a professional responsibility to ensure the safety and integrity of their work. Errors or inadequate quality in the project design phase and construction of buildings or infrastructure may result in significant personal injury, loss of property value and economic harm. Entities that manage structural integrity and safety poorly may incur incremental costs because of redesign or repair work and legal liabilities, as well as reputational damage that could hurt growth prospects. Moreover, when designing and constructing buildings or infrastructure, entities in the industry increasingly must contemplate potential climate change impacts, which may affect the project’s structural integrity and public safety. Compliance with minimum applicable codes and standards may not be enough to maintain and grow reputational value (or even mitigate legal liabilities) in some circumstances, especially if the frequency and severity of climate-change-related events increases as expected. Meeting or exceeding new industry quality standards, and setting upinternal control procedures to identify and fix potential design issues, including those resulting from climate risks, are practices that may help entities reduce these risks."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Landfills are a significant anthropogenic contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because they generate methane. As a result, regulators frequently require entities to limit landfill gas emissions. Entities can reduce these emissions through a variety of control technologies that require significant capital investments such as landfill gas collection efficiency improvements, control devices and increased methane oxidisation. Entities can capture and combust methane using a flare, an engine or a turbine to reduce the overall toxicity and potency of raw emissions dramatically. Landfill gas capture is particularly important for owners and operators of large landfills that have been the focus of regulation. Entities that operate in the waste-to-energy industry segment may reduce waste lifecycle emissions through decreased future emissions from landfills and displaced energy generation, but they face increased Scope 1 emissions from waste-to-energy facilities operations. Overall, GHG emissions pose regulatory risks for the industry, with potential effects on operational costs and capital expenditures. Entities also may generate revenue through the sale of natural gas and energy from waste-to-energy facilities, as well as reduce fuel purchases by using processed landfill gas to power operations. Performance on this issue may affect an entity’s ability to secure new permits or renew existing ones, which can affect revenue."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Air Quality,"Air pollution is the presence of air contaminants in such quantities and duration that they can be injurious to humans, animals, plants, and/or property. It also includes contaminants that interfere with enjoyment of life and/or property. Therefore, odours and toxic gases, such as those emitted from landfills, landfill fires, waste incinerators, and waste treatment plants, are considered air pollution. The financial impacts from excessive air emissions vary depending on the specific location of operations and the prevailing air emissions regulations, but they can include capital expenditures, increased operating costs, fines, and lawsuits from affected communities. Human health impacts and financial consequences of poor air-quality management are likely to be exacerbated by the proximity of waste management facilities to communities. Active management of air pollutants and odours—through technological and process improvements—can therefore mitigate regulatory exposure and the associated future costs of compliance from increasingly stringent air-quality regulations, help entities secure and maintain permits, and protect their license to operate."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Workforce Health & Safety,"The industry’s hazardous working conditions make safety a critical issue for waste management operations, and accidentscan have a great impact on workers. The Waste Management industry has higher fatality rates than most industries. Fatalities and other injuries are due primarily to transportation incidents, contact with hazardous objects and equipment, and exposure to harmful substances. Additionally, temporary workers may be at higher risk because of a lack of training or industry experience. Poor health and safety records can result in fines and penalties and an increase in regulatory compliance costs from more stringent oversight. Waste management entities must ensure that facilities and vehicles are operated with the highest safety standards and that the number of injuries and accidents is minimised through a strong safety culture. Entities that develop proactive safety management plans and training requirements for their employees andcontractors, including conducting regular audits, are likely to improve safety records and minimise the chance of safety-related financial repercussions."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Management of Leachate & Hazardous Waste,"Entities operating landfills are required to manage and reduce risks of potential ecological impacts, including those causedby leachate and hazardous waste. Poor management of landfills and other disposal sites can lead to contamination of thesoil, groundwater, and other nearby water bodies. To mitigate risks to the environment and the health of local communities, entities must effectively contain and manage leachate, as well as hazardous waste. Entities that are unable to manage these risks are likely to receive regulatory penalties, lose brand value, worsen future business prospects, and face lawsuits."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Fleet Fuel Management,"Many entities in the Waste Management industry own and operate large vehicle fleets for waste collection and transfer. The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry cost, both in terms of operating expenses and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts may affect waste management entities through increased regulatory exposure and reduced competitiveness of new contract proposals. Hedging fuel purchases is a common tool used to manage fleet-fuel risks; however, increasingly, waste management entities are upgrading to more fuel-efficient fleets or switching to natural gas vehicles. A cleaner-burning fleet also may be perceived favourably by communities living near waste management facilities with heavy traffic."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Recycling & Resource Recovery,"Recycling, reuse, composting, and incineration are general methods of diverting waste from landfills. Landfill diversion can mitigate some of the environmental impacts of landfills and reduce the need for landfill expansion. Additionally, waste management entities play a critical role in the circular economy by separating and recovering reusable materials such as paper, glass, metal, organic materials, and electronic waste. Pressures from new regulations, customer demand, and the increasing costs of extracting virgin materials are initiating the move toward a circular economy. As a result, wastemanagement entities are facing a decrease in the amount of landfilled waste and an expanding recycling market. Cradle-to-cradle approaches initiated by other industries in the economy have the potential to break down if the recovery and recycling infrastructure or technologies do not exist. Entities that provide recycling and other resource recovery services will be better able to address changing consumer needs, thereby positioning themselves for revenue growth while playinga critical role in reducing the environmental impact of the wider economy."
Infrastructure,Waste Management,Labour Practices,"Organised labour plays an important role in the Waste Management industry. Many workers are covered under collective bargaining agreements that protect workers’ rights and establish wages. High unionisation rates leave waste management entities vulnerable to shutdowns and delays due to worker strikes if labour concerns are not addressed effectively. Proper management of, and communication around, issues such as worker pay and working conditions can prevent conflicts with workers that could lead to extended strikes, which can slow or shut down operations and create reputational risk. Waste management entities need a long-term perspective on managing workers—including their pay and benefits—in a way that protects workers’ rights and enhances their productivity while ensuring the financial sustainability of an entity’s operations."
Consumer Goods,Appliance Manufacturing,Product Safety,"Product safety is of utmost importance to appliance and tool manufacturers. When an appliance malfunctions, it can result in fires or other hazards that damage property and cause injury or even death. The potential for product malfunction and its sometimes-serious consequences exposes firms to risks related to litigation and negative consumer sentiment, which can affect brand value, revenue growth, and/or market share. Failure to report known product safety hazards to relevant authorities can result in civil penalties. Entities that dedicate appropriate resources to quality control and testing can minimise the possibility of a product malfunction or recall, and can capture additional market share and limit their exposure to regulatory and litigation risks."
Consumer Goods,Appliance Manufacturing,Product Lifecycle Environmental Impacts,"Entities in the Appliance Manufacturing industry seek to differentiate their products from those of competitors. One important differentiating factor is the lifecycle environmental impact of products and an entity’s ability to design products with the entire lifecycle in mind, from creation and use to disposal. This includes appliance energy and water efficiency, which account for a significant proportion of a home’s energy and water use, as well as designing for and facilitating safeend-of-life disposal and recycling. Entities designing and manufacturing products to decrease lifecycle environmental impacts are more likely to increase market share owing to a lower cost of ownership, and they may better manage increased regulation related to issues such as extended producer responsibility."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Forestry Management,Rights of Indigenous Peoples,"Forests contribute directly to the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Effective relations and engagement with local communities and indigenous populations can be important to forestry entities. Communities may be affected by forestry management operations because of environmental degradation or competition for natural resources such as land and water. Conflict with communities, including or indigenous populations, could affect an entity’s ability to operate in some regions, result in regulatory action, and could cause brand impacts. Conversely, entities can provide benefits to community stakeholders through employment opportunities, revenue sharing, and increased commerce. Entities can adopt various community engagement strategies to manage the risks and opportunities associated with community rightsand interests, such as maintaining positive relations with local stakeholders and accommodating communities’ needs. "
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Forestry Management,Ecosystem Services & Impacts,"Along with their timber output, forests provide valuable ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, water purification and storage, soil formation, and recreational opportunities. Meanwhile, in many regions, regulations related to water quality and endangered species protection, as well as harvesting rights that are contingent upon environmental preservation, may create operational risks for entities. As such, protecting or enhancing ecosystem services within managed forestlands could mitigate reputational, demand and operational risks related to the potential adverse environmental impacts of forestry. Entities increasingly use third-party certification to show sustainable forestry management practices that serve to enhance forest asset value and productivity, as well as to meet rising consumer demand for sustainably produced forest products."
Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Forestry Management,Climate Change Adaptation,"Global climate change may create long-term business uncertainty for some forestry management entities. Variations in precipitation patterns and temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events and forest fires, and an increased prevalence of tree diseases and pests may impact timberlands adversely through increased mortality or diminished productivity. Conversely, positively impacting forest productivity, climate change also may facilitate forest productivity through increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, a longer growing season, moderating temperatures in high latitudes, greater precipitation, and expanded geographical ranges for some species. Considering such variability, entities may benefit from identifying and understanding potential long-term impacts of climate change on the productivity of forestlands and from adjusting forestry management strategies to optimise the productivity of their forestland assets."
