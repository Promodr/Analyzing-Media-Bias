# Analyzing Media Bias in ESG Coverage: A Semantic Similarity Approach

# Project Overview

In the rapidly evolving landscape of corporate responsibility, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria have become central to business practices, investor decisions, and public policy. As companies integrate ESG considerations into their strategic frameworks, the media plays a pivotal role in shaping public and investor perceptions by reporting on these issues. However, the nature of this coverage can significantly influence stakeholder views and decisions, making it crucial to understand media biases and reporting patterns.

This research project, "Analyzing Media Bias in ESG Coverage: A Semantic Similarity Approach," aims to dissect the coverage patterns of ESG topics across prominent news outlets to detect potential biases or specializations. By scrutinizing how different media platforms report on ESG themes, this study seeks to illuminate the subtleties of media influence on public and corporate engagement with sustainability issues.

# Research Question

Our research investigates whether certain news companies show a propensity to cover specific ESG topics more frequently than others, and if these patterns indicate a bias or specialization in their reporting.

# Data Sources

We utilize three primary datasets:

News Articles Dataset: Contains 24,000 articles from CNBC, Forbes, Business Insider, and Daily Mail.
ESG Definitions Dataset: Definitions from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to classify ESG topics.
S&P 500 Companies Dataset: Maps companies to their respective sectors and industries.

# Repository Structure

data/: Contains the datasets used in the analyses.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the detailed process of our analysis.
output/: Output files including processed datasets and figures generated from the analysis.

## Key Findings
