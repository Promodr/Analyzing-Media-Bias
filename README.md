# Analyzing Media Bias in ESG Coverage: A Semantic Similarity Approach

# Project Overview

# This project explores media biases in the coverage of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics by analyzing articles from major news outlets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to uncover potential biases or specializations in ESG reporting across different media platforms.

# Research Question

Our research investigates whether certain news companies show a propensity to cover specific ESG topics more frequently than others, and if these patterns indicate a bias or specialization in their reporting.

# Data Sources

We utilize three primary datasets:

News Articles Dataset: Contains 24,000 articles from CNBC, Forbes, Business Insider, and Daily Mail.
ESG Definitions Dataset: Definitions from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to classify ESG topics.
S&P 500 Companies Dataset: Maps companies to their respective sectors and industries.

# Repository Structure

data/: Contains the datasets used in the analyses.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the detailed process of our analysis.
output/: Output files including processed datasets and figures generated from the analysis.

## Key Findings

Significant differences in ESG topic coverage among the analyzed news providers.
Patterns in data suggest potential media bias or editorial specialization towards certain ESG topics.
